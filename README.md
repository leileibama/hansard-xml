# Commonwealth of Australia Hansard

These are Hansard XML files downloaded from the [Parliament of Australia website](http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/summary/summary.w3p;adv%3Dyes;orderBy%3D_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;query%3DDataset%3Ahansardr,hansardr80;resCount%3DDefault) by [Tim Sherratt](http://timsherratt.org) in April 2016.

The files are made available on the Parliament website under a [CC-BY-NC-ND licence](http://www.aph.gov.au/Help/Disclaimer_Privacy_Copyright#c).

Currently this repository includes files for the House of Representatives from 1901 to 1965. Browse the files or [download a zip file](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml/archive/master.zip) of the lot (it's about 400mb).

The XML is a bit dodgy in places, so feel free to fork this repository, correct the XML, and send me pull requests.
