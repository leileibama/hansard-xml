      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">His Excellency</inline>the Governor-General entered the chamber and, being seated, with the  President  on his right hand, commanded that a message be sent to the House of Representatives intimating that  His Excellency  desired the attendance of honourable members in the Senate chamber forthwith, who being come with their  Speaker. </para>
      <para>His Excellency was pleased to deliver the following speech: </para>
      <para>Senators and Members of the House of Representatives: </para>
      <para>This 32nd Parliament assembles following a general election in which the people of Australia have again returned my Government with a substantial majority. </para>
      <para>My Government regards this manifestation of the people&#39;s choice as a mandate to maintain the basic thrust of the policies which have been followed over the past five years. </para>
      <para>These policies are designed to work for the well-being of all Australians and to develop a society which maximises the rewards of individual effort and initiative, and which also respects the right of individuals to shape their own lives. </para>
      <para>The Government&#39;s program is set out comprehensively in the policy speech which the Prime Minister delivered to the nation on 30 September of this year and in the supplementary statements which accompanied that speech. My Government is committed to the whole of that program and will work with determination to implement it as fully and rapidly as possible. </para>
      <para>I emphasise this because in this speech I shall focus on some of the key elements of that program rather than merely recite the whole of it in bald form. The fact that I do so should not be interpreted as meaning that areas not mentioned by me are in any way downgraded or discarded by my Government. A selection is made in order to keep the speech within reasonable limits, but the program stands in its entirety. </para>

          <title>Unemployment and Youth</title>
          <page.no>2</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The first element of that program to which I wish to draw particular attention is the provision it contains for overcoming unemployment in general and particularly for stimulating the employment of youth. This is placed first because of the great importance my Government attaches to it. </para>
        <para>In recent years, and for a number of reasons, the question of jobs for young people has emerged as a crucial one, not only in Australia but in virtually all Western countries. It is not only an economic problem but a social one. Indeed, for the young people involved and their families it is a major psychological and human problem. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that the long-term solution to it undoubtedly lies in the creation of new jobs by restoring healthy economic growth, and in this respect Australia is much better placed than many other industrial countries. Over the next few years, resources and manufacturing development projects will certainly create tens of thousands of new jobs. </para>
        <para>But the matter cannot be left there, has not been left there, and will not be left there. </para>
        <para>During the last five years over half a million Australians have received specific help through my Government&#39;s manpower and training programs. Nearly another quarter million will receive assistance during this year. </para>
        <para>My Government has a clear and firm commitment to youth, exemplified by its announcement of new initiatives, including the introduction of a new allowance to encourage young unemployed persons to take advantage of training opportunities, the expansion of its work experience programs and the provision of improved counselling services. </para>
        <para>All of these initiatives will be in place by February next year. </para>
        <para>During 1981 my Government will take action to place increased emphasis on employment and training schemes. </para>
        <para>A framework is being established within which the Government&#39;s training programs will provide a wide range of incentives and allowances to increase the supply of skills required for economic development, and to assist the unemployed, particularly the young and disadvantaged, to obtain employment. </para>

          <title>The Economy</title>
          <page.no>3</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I turn now to the economic policies of my Government. These policies are determined by and given coherence by an economic strategy which is designed to restore economic stability and improve growth within a medium term framework. Sudden large changes in economic policies will continue to be avoided. </para>
        <para>This strategy has already resulted in an encouraging pick-up in activity and employment and a marked strengthening in business investment. There is, however, a continued need for the firm application of consistent policies to reduce inflation and to allow our national resources to be employed in areas where the highest economic return can be obtained. </para>
        <para>A primary objective of my Government will be to continue the fight against inflation. Inflation results in fewer jobs and lower living standards for everybody. Firm anti-inflationary fiscal and monetary policies are therefore essential to any lasting solution to the problems of unemployment, the achieving of higher growth and the more rapid raising of living standards, on a sustainable basis. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that there is no realistic alternative to such policies, and that alternative policies, including those which are inappropriately described as stimulatory, would set back the economic recovery now under way and create renewed uncertainty. </para>
        <para>My Government will give particular attention to encouraging the growth of the private sector and to increasing the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes. It will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide scope for reducing the burden of taxation. </para>
        <para>Improved private sector growth will require further improvements in business profitability, which still provides insufficient incentive to increased investment in many industries. My Government&#39;s policies will, therefore, seek to contain wage increases in the short term, in the interests of expanding aggregate employment and income over the medium term. </para>
        <para>Private sector growth is dependent on secure supplies of energy. My Government will continue to pursue this objective by allowing the price of liquid fuels in particular to reflect so far as possible the operation of market forces. This policy is encouraging the development of a diversified energy base, which will minimise Australia&#39;s reliance on imported liquid fuels, and is helping to conserve scarce Australian energy resources for future generations. </para>
        <para>My Government&#39;s economic policies have considerably improved Australia&#39;s international competitiveness and enhanced export opportunities for Australian industries. A sustained lift in exports and a higher level of capital inflow will increase Australia&#39;s capacity to import and to undergo the structural changes which allow economic growth to build upon itself as resources move to areas of higher profitability. My Government will encourage this process within an economic environment in which industry can invest for the future with confidence. </para>
        <para>In the context of the economy, my Government wishes to make a simple but vital philosophical point. Discussion of the economy and of economic policy has become so abstract, so specialised, so dominated by statistics and rarefied concepts that the connection between it and the lives of ordinary people is in danger of being obscured if not lost sight of altogether. It is essential that it be understood that economics and people are linked, that economic policy must serve human objectives and that the discussion be conducted in such a way that it becomes clear that what are being talked about are the jobs, incomes, assets and prospects of men and women. My Government will make a serious effort to give a lead in this respect, recognising that continuing public understanding and support are vital to the success of its policies, not least in the contribution they can make to the urgent task of improving industrial relations in this country. </para>

          <title>Caring for People</title>
          <page.no>4</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In what I have said about unemployment, youth and the economy, I have stressed my Government&#39;s concern with the human dimensions of the issues involved. It believes that the only legitimate yardstick for assessing any policy is not conformity to an ideology, not the strengthening of the state, but the effectiveness of that policy in enhancing the lives of people. This is the fundamental concern of my Government. </para>
        <para>This concern expresses itself in a diverse range of measures to which my Government is committed: </para>
        <para>It is evident in the commitment of my Government to a range of social security and welfare measures which will strengthen the family and through it the basic social fabric of this country. My Government has already introduced a number of measures designed to assist families. It will be looking closely at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. </para>
        <para>It is evident in programs to subsidise accommodation for aged persons, to assist homeless persons, to assist low or moderate income earners in house purchasing, and in the strong commitment made by my Government to welfare housing. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the programs developed in the context of the International Year of Disabled Persons 1981 to assist the education of severely handicapped children and to increase employment opportunities for the disabled. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the commitment to improve aboriginal health standards. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the area of ethnic affairs, in the commitment to provide services both to help migrants adjust to life in Australia and to help them to maintain in Australia the cultural heritages of the countries from which they came. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the commitment to encourage excellence in a number of fields- for example, to provide greater support and improved facilities for research, to encourage the arts and to provide greater opportunity for young Australian athletes. </para>
        <para>This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. My Government sets it out to establish that it cares deeply about the quality of life lived in Australia and that it is determined to give practical expression to that care. In doing so, my Government&#39;s objective will be not to increase long-term dependence on the Government, but, consistent with its liberal philosophy, to provide the means whereby people can become more independent and freer to choose the lives they want to live. </para>

          <title>The Public Service</title>
          <page.no>4</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I have mentioned the liberal philosophy of my Government. My Government wishes it to be clearly understood that it is in terms of that philosophy that it approaches the questions of growth in Government expenditure, in the public sector, and in the size of the Public Service. Its concern to maintain strict control over that growth is not based on any animus against the Public Service. It does not subscribe to the crude and usually uninformed hostility towards that Service which sometimes receives popular expression. It recognises and appreciates the contribution which the Public Service as a whole makes to the life of this country. </para>
        <para>But my Government does believe profoundly that it is vitally important that the power and functions of the State should be limited and contained. It does believe that the State is likely to be in many ways an inefficient and wasteful provider and that many services can be better supplied in other ways. And it does believe that the expansion of private enterprise is the best means to achieve the well-being and health of a society. </para>
        <para>For these reasons, my Government recently announced the establishment of a Committee of Senior Ministers to review the functions of all Commonwealth departments and associated agencies. The review will recommend to the Government which functions might be reduced, eliminated or altered so as to achieve a more efficient and economical administration. The review will also examine areas where Commonwealth activities overlap with those of the States or unnecessarily intrude into areas of activity capable of being performed efficiently by the private sector. </para>
        <para>The review is part of a continuing process of restraint on the public sector which has been maintained since my Government came to office. In that period the number of Commonwealth employees in areas subject to staff ceilings has been reduced by over 10,000. This has been achieved without weakening those areas of the administration where there are special needs. In fact, the numbers employed by the Department of Social Security have actually increased by 3,000 in the last five years, and the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service has grown by about 1 ,000 in the same period. </para>
        <para>My Government will continue to ensure that Commonwealth activities are concentrated in areas of greatest need and that the adequacy of those services, appropriately provided by the Commonwealth, is maintained. </para>

          <page.no>5</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The last area of policy to which I shall refer is that of foreign affairs and defence. </para>
        <para>The past year has seen a significant heightening of international tension and uncertainty. While we must hope that it turns out to be mistaken, it must be recognised that the consensus of informed opinion, at present, is that the period encompassed by the life of this Parliament is likely to be a troubled and tense one in international affairs. </para>
        <para>The foreign policy priorities of my Government are clear. It is very conscious of the need for a strong and united Western stance towards the Soviet Union and to this end it will work to maintain its already strong ties with its traditional allies, and in particular with the United States. It should be clearly understood that it will do so out of an appreciation of Australia&#39;s needs and interests and for no other reason. </para>
        <para>Beyond this my Government will concentrate its efforts heavily within the region, broadly defined, and on the Commonwealth of Nations. Through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting, my Government has succeeded in linking these two areas of interest in a new and advantageous way - and of linking both in turn with our interest in Third World matters. </para>
        <para>Australia has been chosen as host of the 1981 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This will be the largest and most important international conference ever to have been held in this country. It will take place at a time when discussions of north/south issues will be receiving a new impetus and it should be able to make a valuable contribution to the discussion of those issues. </para>
        <para>In the present state of international tension, my Government is mindful that its first responsibility is the nation&#39;s security and it has taken appropriate steps to enhance Australia&#39;s defence preparedness. The 1980-81 Budget provides for a real increase in defence spending of about 7 per cent. Further substantial real increases in resources are planned in the years to 1984-85 by which time defence expenditure is expected to have risen to about 3 per cent of gross domestic product. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that it is imperative that Australia should move to improve its defence self-reliance and should play its part in strengthening the international forces working for stability at the global and regional levels. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I have outlined important parts of my Government&#39;s program and policies for the next three years. In doing so I have made some passing references to the beliefs which provide the underlying rationale of these policies and give them coherence. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that this- an explanation to the Australian people of the ideas, principles and values in terms of which the Government of the day shapes its policies - is something which has been somewhat neglected in Australia and that this neglect has diminished the quality of political life of the country. It believes that this should be remedied. During the life of this Parliament, therefore, my Government will be making a serious and sustained effort to explain to the Australian people the philosophy on which it bases its approach to governing - a philosophy which it sees as liberal in its principles, flexible and undogmatic in its application of those principles to the realities of Australian life and conservative in its distrust of abrupt and sweeping changes as a means of achieving desired ends. </para>

      <para class="block">DEATH OF SIR JOHN McEWEN </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARRICK</inline>(New South WalesLeader of the Government in the Senate) - It is with very deep regret that I confirm to the Senate the death on 20 November 1980 of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen. I am sure that honourable senators will join me in paying tribute to a man who served his country and this Parliament so well for so many years. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen was a member of the House of Representatives for 36 years. A farmer himself, he always retained a deep understanding of the problems and concerns of rural Australians. He had been active in the Country Party before standing, successfully, as the Country Party candidate for Echuca in the 1934 general elections. After only three years as a member of parliament, he was appointed by Prime Minister Lyons to the portfolio of Minister for the Interior, a post which he held for one and a half years. He served with distinction as Minister for External Affairs in 1940 and as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation in 1941 until the Fadden Government was defeated in the Parliament late in that year. In 1 940 and 1 941 he also served as a member of the War Cabinet. </para>
      <para>During his years in opposition he continued to serve the Parliament and his party. He was a member of the Australian Advisory War Council from 1941 to 1945 and he became  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party in 1 943. Upon the Menzies coalition&#39;s return to government in 1949, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen was appointed Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. In 1956 this portfolio was reorganised to become the ministry of Trade and in 1963 it was broadened to Trade and Industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> developed the portfolio throughout these changes, establishing close contacts with leaders of primary and secondary industries during a period when the emphasis of Australia&#39;s economy was shifting away from the rural sector. Determination and strength of character were hallmarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John&#39;s</inline> career from the time of his struggles to establish his Stanhope property during the Depression when other soldier settlers were turning away from the land. </para>
      <para>As Minister for Trade he had the responsibility of reconciling what many people saw as the contradictions inherent in the portfolio- the need for protection to develop local manufacturing versus the free trade favoured by rural and mining industries. That he achieved this without losing the support of traditional Country Party supporters is further testimony to his political skill. He remained in the Trade and Industry portfolio until his retirement in 1971. In 1958 he became leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>McEwen was one of only three Country Party Prime Ministers since Federation. He also served under the other two - Page in 1939 and Fadden in 1941. He assumed the prime ministership under tragic circumstances upon the disappearance in late 1967 of Prime Minister Harold Holt and he held that office for a brief 23 days. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> was a great Australian, a man for whom Australia always came first. He was an inspiration to all who knew him.  His  long, dedicated and distinguished service was acknowledged by the honours awarded to him. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1 953 and a Companion of Honour in 1969. Just prior to his retirement he was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> retired from Parliament and the Ministry in January 1971. All honourable senators will join me in offering our deepest sympathy to Lady McEwen. I move: </para>

        <title>DEATH OF FORMER SENATOR V. C. GAIR</title>
        <page.no>17</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CARRICK</inline>(New South WalesLeader of the Government in the Senate) - It is with regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 1 1 November 1980 of the Honourable Vincent Gair. The death of Vince Gair represents not only the end of a long political career- over some 60 years - but also the passing of an era which had lasting effects on the course of Australian politics. It is doubtful that we will see his like again. He was much a man shaped by the times in which he lived - two world wars, the depression of the 1930s and the post-war boom of the 1950s. </para>
      <para>Vince Gair was 14 years of age when he began his association with the Australian Labor Party and he was a member of the Queensland Branch for over 30 years. He served in the Queensland Parliament from 1932 to 1960, was a Minister from 1942 to 1952,  Deputy  Premier from 1947 to 1952, and Premier from 1952 until 1957, when his connection with the ALP was severed. He then formed the Queensland Labor Party, which later merged with the Australian Democratic Labor Party. It was as a representative of the DLP that he was elected as a senator for Queensland in 1965. He immediately became Leader of the DLP in the Senate, and held the position until 1973. In 1974 he resigned from the Senate to take up his appointment as Ambassador to Ireland. </para>
      <para>While a member of the Senate he contributed to the work of a number of parliamentary committees: The Library Committee from 1965 to 1974; the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade from 1970 to 1971; and the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House from 1969 to 1970. He was a member of several select committees of the Senate: The Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes from 1967 to 1968; the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources from 1967 to 1971; and the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution in 1 968. </para>
      <para>Vince Gair was an able politician. He was recognised as a tough, tenacious opponent who fought vigorously for what he believed was right. He was a courageous man who pursued his objectives regardless of the consequences for him or his associates. It was because he held to his convictions against pressure from the extraparliamentary ALP Executive that he lost the Queensland premiership and was expelled from the ALP. He earned the respect of his contemporaries for his astuteness as a bargainer and for the way in which he made the best use of his comprehensive understanding of constitutional, parliamentary and political processes to gain his objectives. </para>
      <para>Vince Gair has left his mark on many of the major political events of his time. The judgment as to the merits of his overall contribution to Australian political life over the greater part of this century is a matter for the historians. But Vince Gair will be remembered for his courage, his very real ability, and long and distinguished service to both Queensland and the Australia in which he fervently believed. Our sincere sympathy goes out to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. I move: </para>
