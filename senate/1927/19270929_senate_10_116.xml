            <para>- Honorable senators will have noticed that this chamber differs in many respects from that which we, until recently, occupied in Melbourne. Especially is this so in the matter of entrance doors and passage-ways, which here are far more numerous. To avoid any confusion, I desire to inform honorable senators that I propose, with their concurrence, to adopt the following practice with regard to. divisions and the application of Standing Order  171: - </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When the bells are rung, only the front door and the two main side doors will be kept open until the order to close the doors is given, and honorable senators are. requested to enter by these as the corner doors and one of the back doors will be locked. </para>
          <para>Further, with regard to the passageways around the chamber, the rule will be that when the Senate is in division, the names will be taken of only those senators who are inside the line of the partition which is immediately behind the back row of seats&#39;. I feel sure that these arrangements will commend themselves to honorable senators, and I ask their assistance in carrying them out. </para>

        <para>The results for the year just closed exceeded the budget estimate. At the beginning of the year it was estimatedthat there would be a surplus of &#163;149,381. The actual surplus proved to be &#163;2,635,597. This improvement was mainly due to the following increases in revenue compared with the estimate - </para>

        <para>On the expenditure side there was an increase of &#163;390,790 in statutory payments, chiefly on account of invalid and old-age pensions, war pensions and wine export bounty. There was also an increase of &#163;204,151 under miscellaneous services. This was chiefly due to the expenses in connexion with the recent visit of the Duke of York, provision for temporary assistance to the apple-growers of Tasmania, and an additional amount required to pay the guaranteed price to cotton-growers. There were sundry other variations in revenue and expenditure which contributed the balance of the increased surplus. </para>

          <page.no>70</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I shall now deal with the budget proposals for the financial year 1927-8. These proposals are based on the assumption that the financial agreement which was arrived at by the Commonwealth and State Governments at the recent conferences in June and July last will be ratified by the respective Parliaments. Honorable senators are aware that previous conferences had been held since 1919, but that no agreement could be arrived at in connexion with the vexed question of financial relationship. In the meantime capitation payments were paid to the States under the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act 1910, although Parliament had the right to discontinue or vary the payments at any time since 1920. That system of payments has been recognized as unsatisfactory in many respects, and it has been evident that it could not be left in its existing uncertain condition. After carefully considering the whole matter, the Government came to the conclusion that the existing arrangement should be replaced by some system which would grant adequate compensation to the States from a definite source for a definite period. </para>
        <para>As a first step towards a final settlement of the question, Parliament, at the instance of the Government, repealed the capitation payments as from the 30th June, 1927. Parliament also provided for financial assistance to the States for 1927-8, subject to the terms of any agree ment that mightbe arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>
        <para>As a next step the Government invited the States to an open conference to find the best substitute for the capitation system. At this conference the Commonwealth Government submitted for the consideration of the States a scheme based on the following proposals :  - </para>

        </list>
        <para>These proposals were thoroughly discussed and subsequently embodied in a draft agreement which was approved by the Sydney conference, subject to final drafting alterations by the law officers. It will be necessary to secure an amendment of the Constitution to give full effect to the agreement, but, in the meantime, the provisions of the permanent agreement are to be applied as far as practicable for a temporary period of two years, commencing from the 1st July, 1927. </para>
        <para>In accordance with the agreement arrived at, provision has been made in the budget for 1927-28 for the following payments by the Commonwealth to or for the States: - </para>
        <para class="block">

        </para>
        <para>Under the States Grants Act 1927 provision was made for payments to the States during 1927-28 of &#163;7,734,990, subject to any agreement made between the Commonwealth and the States and adopted by Parliament. Payments under the agreement will therefore in 1927-28 be &#163;900,455 more than the payments provided for under the States Grants Act. </para>
        <para>Estimated Expenditure from Revenue 1927-28. </para>
        <para>Having thus outlined the effect of the financial agreement with the States, 1 now propose to deal with other phases of the budget for 1927-28. If honorable senators will turn to pages 6 to 9 of the printed budget papers they will see a summary of the budget, together with corresponding figures for previous years. </para>
        <para>Under Part 1. - Departments and services other than business undertakings and territories of the Commonwealth - the estimated expenditure for 1927-28 is &#163;50,855,434, an increase of &#163;809,485 over the actual expenditure 1926-27. This increase is made up as follows :  - </para>
        <para class="block">
          <graphic href="116332192709294_5_1.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>The net increase of &#163;326,293, under war repatriation and defence expenditure is mainly due to war pensions and increased interest, which will result from the conversion of war loans bearing 4&#189; per cent. and 5 per cent. interest that will mature in December next. </para>
        <para>The increase of &#163;260,760 in interest and sinking fund on loans for works is mainly due to migration loans to the States and the Grafton-South Brisbane railway. A substantial portion of this increase will be recovered from the British Government and the States. </para>
        <para>The increase of &#163;255,411 under invalid and old-age pensions is due to the increase in the number of pensioners. </para>
        <para>The increase of &#163;142,541 under ordinary votes of departments is mainly due to the activities of the Development and Migration Commission, and to the increased health programme as recommended by the Royal Commission on Health. </para>
        <para>Part II. - Business Undertakings. </para>
        <para>The estimated expenditure of the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department from revenue for 1927-28 is &#163;12,223,353, and the estimated revenue of the Post Office is &#163;12,391,000. The estimated surplus is, therefore, &#163;167,647. The expansion of business, increased rates of pay due to Arbitration Court awards, additional payments to railways departments for the carriage of mails, a higher scale of payment to nonofficial postmasters, and the increased cost of operating large additions to the telephone, telegraph, and postal services, interest and sinking fund, make it necessary to provide &#163;937,454 more than was expended in 1926-27. </para>
        <para>Reference to the figures in the budget statement relative to &#39;Commonwealth railways will show that there has been a steady improvement in the finances of all lines controlled by the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para class="block">Part III. - Territories of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para class="block">The estimated expenditure on the territories under the control of the Commonwealth for 1927-28 is &#163;615,405, and the estimated revenue is &#163;169,190, the result being an estimated deficit of &#163;446,215 for the year. In 1926-27 there was a deficit of &#163;364,045. The increased deficit is mainly due to the expenses of the transfer of staffs to Canberra, and the provision of &#163;70,000 for the purchase of Melbourne homes of officers transferred. This amount of &#163;70,000, however, will be subsequently recovered. </para>

        <para class="block">These sums represent an increase of &#163;885,000 over the corresponding payments for 1926-27. This is due to the provisions of the financial agreement with the States. Under that agreement there is to be, as already stated, a further payment of &#163;165,533 representing the increased interest on transferred properties. This amount is shown under the estimates of the departments concerned. All the States have now signed the Federal Aid Roads Agreement. Last year a special duty which was levied on petrol was estimated to produce &#163;1,000,000 towards the road grant. The Government now proposes to levy other duties which it is estimated will realize a further sum of &#163;500,000 a year. </para>

        <para>For 1926-27 it was estimated that the loan expenditure would amount to &#163;10,000,000; the actual expenditure was &#163;7,748,417, a decrease of &#163;2,251,583. The loan programme for 1927-28 is estimated to require&#163;9,000,000. The following table gives the principal items included in that estimate as well as a comparison with the actual expenditure for 1926-27 : - </para>

        </para>
        <para>Provision is also made in the loan budget for &#163;3,750,000 for migration loans to the States, and for the raising of loans to the amount of &#163;2,000,000 on behalf of the Federal Capital Commission. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, I desire to emphasize that the outstanding features of this budget are the reduction of direct taxation and the proposed new financial relationship between the Commonwealth and the States as agreed upon by the respective Governments at the recent conference. The proposed reduction of taxation is particularly gratifying, in view of the additional obligations towards the States that the Government will assume. In 1921-22 the collections from direct taxation amounted to &#163;22,048,000, equal to &#163;4 per head of the population. The estimated collections in 1927-28 are &#163;13,750,000, or &#163;2 4s.1d. per head. The reductions now proposed should act as an incentive to industry, and thus benefit the wholecommunity. The financial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States represents a land-mark in Commonwealth finance. Henceforth there should be the closest cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States on this most important phase of governmental administration. The additional burden which the Commonwealth will assume will be repaid to Australia many times by the enhanced credit we shall obtain abroad, and the saving in interest that will result. Finally, I remind honorable senators that should they desire to debate the general principles underlying the budget, they should do so when the motion for the printing of the budget papers is before the chamber, as that will be their only effective opportunity to do so. The Appropriation Bill usually comes before this chamber rather late in the session, when there is only sufficient time to discuss the items in the estimates. </para>

              <para>- The chances are that it would have made a good deal of money. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry.</inline> Barwell evidently confuses this proposed line with that unfortunate line that runs north from Oodnadatta, and which is certainly bound to lose a great deal of money and may perhaps cost this government a great deal more than it can very well afford. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> proposal is to build a separate line that will run through good country and give to the people of Australia some return for the capital expenditure upon it. It will have some reasonable hope of meeting the interest bill on the cost of construction, and it will afford an almost unlimited opportunity for the future development of the Northern Territory and the western areas of Queensland and New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- I shall give reasons for my assertion. The first point put forward by the deputation that waited upon the Prime Minister, was that Northern Queensland and the Northern Territory are to-day the great cattle producing areas of A.ustralia. I shall enlarge upon that point later. The second point advanced was that the construction of the railway would provide an insurance against the effects of drought in the areas traversed by it, in a way that perhaps could not be provided for by any other scheme the Government or any one else could put forward. The third point was that it would lead to the opening up of large areas for the development of the sheep industry. A line built from Bourke to Berrigan and thence on to Cunnamulla and Camooweal, would open up sufficient new country to carry 10,000,000 sheep, the annual value of which would be &#163;5,000,000. A railway running through country providing for such intense development would certainly offer every reasonable prospect of returning interest upon cost of production, and perhaps also an adequate sinking fund to repay the capital cost in the course of years. </para>

              <para>- I have. The New South Wales Graziers&#39; Association which was represented through the United Graziers&#39; Association at the deputation to the Prime Minister, has been advocating the construction of this railway for at least ten years. In the opinion of this association the building of the line would develop country notonly in New South Wales and Queensland, but also on the Barkly Tableland in Commonwealth territory. It was said by gentlemen who know the country which the suggested line would serve that the markets for the products &#174;f the Barkly Tableland do not lie in the south. The difficulties of transport in thenorth are great, because of the fact that the principal markets for beef and mutton, particularly beef, are in the eastern States. To give theproducers in that area direct communication with Melbourne and Sydney and other large centres of population, theconstruction of a line over the route suggested is essential. </para>

              <para>- I am pointing out that although the north-south line may run close to the Barkly Tableland products from that part of the Commonwealth will have to be taken over an enormous distance by rail to reach the principal markets. If the products of the Barkly Tableland were taken to Adelaide they would then have to be transported to Melbourne and Sydney, thus making the cost so prohibitive that business would be unprofitable. Surely we ought to give the people settled on the Barkly Tableland direct communication with the large centres of population on the east coast instead of compelling them to send their produce to Adelaide. South Australia will benefit by the northsouth railway, which will provide direct communication between the north and the south, and give great assistance to settlement. This suggested railway is more in the nature of a developmental line to tap country and undeveloped resources that the north-south railway cannot in any circumstances assist. I submit that there is ample justification for the construction of the two lines. If the construction of the north-south line is necessary we are even more justified in supporting the building of a railway over the route I suggest. </para>

              <para>- No. According to statements made by members of the deputation which waited upon the Prime Minister the trend of development in Australia is in the direction of slowly squeezing out large landholders, who, in the past, have undertaken the scientific breeding of stock. The smaller landholders have not the same resources at their command, and Australia&#39;s prominent position to-day in the matter of wool production is due to the fact that large landholders have been able to carry out their experimental work on an extensive scale. </para>

              <para>- I know that. I am pointing out that the large pastoralists are gradually being forced further back owing to the compulsory acquisition of land for closer settlement. If, as a result of the imposition&#39; of unimproved land values taxation, and the compulsory acquistion of lands for closer settlement, these men are being forced further out, it is the duty of the Commonwealth and States to provide them with adequate railway facilities instead of making it practically impossible for them to obtain a return for their industry. Here is a way in which we can assist them. As SenatorThompson interjected a little while ago this proposal has been made on several previous occasions. Some years ago the New South Wales Parliament discussed the construction of the New South Wales section, and referred the scheme to the Public Works Committee of that State. The subject was fully considered, but. owing to financial problems then confronting the Commonwealth nothing was done. In 1914 the Commonwealth Government of the day asked the Queensland Government to be represented at a conference to consider the construction of such a line, but as at that time it was fully occupied in building a north coast railway to Cairns and was involved in other big financial obligations it had regretfully to decline the invitation of the Commonwealth to confer. Shortly after, the war supervened and all railway construction projects of any magnitude were temporarily abandoned. It was, I think, in 1918 that the Queensland Government approached the Commonwealth authorities and said that it was then in a position to favorably consider the construction of its portion of the work, but the Commonwealth Government was not prepared to go on and nothing further was done. Discussions have taken place and reports have been submitted from time to time; but up to date nothing effective has been accomplished. In the interest of the Commonwealth and of Australia generally this line should be built. If this motion is carried by the Senate and agreed to in another place the whole matter will be re-opened and negotiations between the Commonwealth and the governments of Queensland and New South Wales will then be proceeded with. As a result of such a conference an agreement may be reached under which it will be practicable - taking into consideration the financial positions of the States - to proceed with the construction of the line. If the suggested line was in existence to-day it would be possible for millions of sheep which, owing to drought conditions, are now, unfortunately, being lost in western Queensland and western New South Wales, to reach good pasture lands. The present drought is one of the most severe that has been experienced in recent years; it has resulted in the loss of about seven million sheep. In the Barkly Tableland and other similar good country there are almost unlimited supplies of feed. Had this line been in operation many thousands &#39; of those sheep would have been saved. </para>

              <para>- He said that the deputation was asking the Commonwealth to undertake what was really really a State activity; but he forgot to say that the Commonwealth had already established a precedent. The Commonwealth is assisting the States in the construction and maintenance of main roads, which is essentially a State activity. Surely if it is within its rights in doing that work it would be acting constitutionally in- entering into an agreement with the States for the construction of developmental railways. </para>

The construction of this line would assist the development of the Northern Territory, and incidentally portions of western New South Wales and western Queensland.

              <para>- He was not very sympathetic. But I do not know that the Senate need heed the dictum of the Prime Minister, on such an important matter as that. We are here to determine for ourselves what should be done. The Prime Minister may change his mind if he realises that an important body of opinion in this Parliament favors at least an investigation of the proposal; he may acquiesce in the suggestion that a conference be held between the Commonwealth and the State Governments with regard to the matter. The importance of the north-south line from a defence standpoint has been stressed on many occasions. We have been told that the Northern Territory and other portions of Australia contiguous to it cannot be defended adequately without railway communication which would permit of the ready transportation of troops. I submit, therefore, that from a defence point of view, the proposal now under consideration is also of supreme importance, because if the line is constructed it will place the northern portion of Australia in direct touch with the larger centres of population. To transport troops to the north, it would be necessary, with the existing railway facilities, to send them from the eastern States through Melbourne to Adelaide, and thence on to Darwin. The railway which we are now advocating would give direct communication between the larger centres of population and Northern Australia. Thus, from a defence standpoint, quite apart from the other considerations I have named, the Government would be fully justified in giving it careful consideration. </para>

              <para>- It would be the business of the defence authorities to prevent that. Australians, I remind the honorable senator, are not in the habit of providing opportunities for other people in that way. I leave the matter there. I appeal to honorable senators to consider the proposal not in a parochial spirit, but from the broader viewpoint as to what would be best in the interests of the Commonwealth. This scheme should not be prejudiced by the suggestion that it might come into some competition with the direct north-south railway. </para>

But it is not for the Senate at this stage to say what the gauge should be. That is a matter which we might very well leave to experts to determine. All we are asking now is that the Senate shall, by endorsing the motion, intimate to the Government that the proposal is well worthy of consideration. If we do that I feel sure that the Ministry will enter into negotiations with the States with a view to enquiring into the feasibility and probable cost of the proposal. </para>

It asks this Senate definitely to commit itself to the statement that it is essential that this work be proceeded with, and that the Government should treat the matter as urgent. Another reason for opposing the motion has just occurred to me. Last session the North Australia Commission was appointed to consider the development of the whole of the Northern Territory, and to ascertain the measures necessary for the expansion of its resources. That commission has been at work for twelve months, and it is expected that the Government will receive its first report shortly. It may recommend this particular work. </para>

              <para>- I am not ; it is not my baby. I realize how deplorable is the loss of stock occasioned by drought in this particular part of the Commonwealth. If anything can be done to obviate such losses in the future it ought to be clone. I admit that the whole question should be investigated very carefully. I believe in the construction of railways for the settlement and development of the country; but I am not prepared at this stage to commit myself to the proposal contained in the motion. Surely honorable senators would be acting wrongly if they did not await the report of the North Australia Commission, which will be furnished in a few months, and will outline the steps which it thinks ought to be taken. I do not for a moment consider that this line would pay interest on the cost of construction. I doubt if it would pay even working expenses. It certainly would prove helpful in times of drought. But the Barkly Tableland does not often experience a drought such as that through which we are passing at the present time. </para>

              <para>- Sheep could not be taken there under existing conditions. When I was in the Territory in 1923, I met a man who was running 4,000 sheep north-west of Alice Springs. He sent them to the Adelaide market, where they fetched the top price. He informedme, however, that he had to give up sheepraising there because of the ravages of wild dogs. The blacks were totally unreliable as shepherds, and allowed the dogs to get into the holdings. </para>

              <para>- It will not for many years. If we were to construct another line running parallel to the north-south railway now in course of construction it would take from that line portion of the revenue that it would otherwise receive. I am perfectly certain that no honorable senator has in his possession sufficient information to enable him to say whether or not this line would pay interest on the cost of construction, or even working expenses. We are advised by financial experts, and by our creditors in the Old Country, that it is necessary to restrict our borrowing, and that public expenditure must be confined at present to reproductive works. In a young country there must be a certain amount of expenditure on public works that will not be immediately reproductive; but it is essential that we should exercise the greatest care in view of the serious financial position in whichwe find ourselves  to-day. That is another reason why the Senate should not be asked to commit itself blindly to a proposal involving the expenditure of several millions of pounds. If the matter were brought before Parliament after&#39; reports had been obtained from the North Australia Commission, the Senate, having already agreed to this motion, would be in in the position of having bound itself in ignorance of the facts of the case. That would be entirely wrong, and it is a step that honorable senators should not be asked to take. I sincerely hope that the Senate will not agree to the motion. </para>

              <para>- Such a body of men would be able to express an opinion which might influence this Chamber, or another place. It would be in a position similar to that now occupied by the Public Works Committee. The motion, if agreed to, would enable information which would be of considerable value to Parliament to be obtained. Despite the adverse reports of engineering and railway experts, South Australian senators have consistently advocated the construction of the northsouth railway, believing that its construction would benefit Australia as a whole, and South Australia in particular. The object of the motion now before us is to impress upon the Government the urgency of the construction of this railway. </para>

              <para>- &#34;Various chambers of commerce, and persons interested in our pastoral country, have advocated the construction of this railway, because of its usefulness in times of drought. All the main railway lines in Queensland which run through pastoral country have, from the beginning, paid interest on the cost of construction. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of many lines which serve agricultural districts. The railways to Longreach, Cunnamulla, Hughenden, and Cloncurry have always paid interest on the capital cost. I am convinced that this railway also would pay its way. </para>

For my part, I am willing to wait for the report  of  that commission. When the Prime Minister was in Brisbane recently a deputation comprising pastoralists, financiers, and others, waited on him to urge the construction of this line of railway, but without success. On that occasion the Prime Minister might not accurately have interpreted public opinion. In any case, must this Senate  dp  nothing merely because the Prime Minister did not see eye to eye with the members of the deputation? I am very desirous that North Australia should be developed. Practical men who know the country are of the opinion that it should be stocked with cattle in the first instance. </para>

              <para>- In the early development of North-West Queensland cattle&#39; played an important part; in more recent years much of the country has been devoted to sheep. At this <inline font-style="italic">stage</inline> I shall not discuss whether the Barkly Tableland is more suitable for cattle or sheep ; at first, the country should be stocked with cattle. Wild dogs are so numerous in parts of Queensland and North Australia that the raising of sheep would be attended- with much difficulty. Not long ago a grazier in Western Queensland told me that in one paddock containing about five square^ miles, which was fenced with dog-proof wire netting, 45 wild dogs were found after the fencing was completed. The Senate should not. accept the Prime Minister&#39;s attitude towards the deputation which waited upon him in Brisbane-  as the final word on this subject. For thp development of Australia railways are necessary. A request coming from the Senate in the form of this motion would have some influence with the Government. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barwell</inline> that, because of our unsatisfactory financial position, we should proceed carefully, and see that for all expenditure we get a satisfactory return ; but I do not think that North Australia need any longer be the &#34; white elephant &#34; it has been in the past. The construction of railways linking that portion of the continent with Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia would make available large areas of pastoral country. </para>

              <para>- Yes. A line should branch off the north-south railway at some point to pass through the Barkly Tableland and connect the Northern Territory with New SouthWales and Queensland. I leave it to the North Australian Commission or experts to determine the point where the proposed railway should branch off. If the Senate passes this motion, the Government will, </para>
