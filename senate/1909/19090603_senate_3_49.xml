        <para class="block">I am submitting identically the same motion as that which was discussed at considerable length &#39;yesterday. An amendment was then submitted, and the debate was terminated by a count-out. I trust that, in view of the fact that the other House has adjourned until the 23rd inst., honorable senators will be content to allow the present motion to go without discussion. I would point out to them that, even if they should re-submit the amendment which was offered &#39; yesterday and&#39; it should be carried, they would not in any way further the work of the Senate, whilst they might greatly inconvenience other honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- Under no possible circumstances will there be a Ministerial statement made on the 16th inst., and until that statement is made I take it that it will be incompetent for the Senate to seriously address itself to the business of the country. I have no desire to say anything that may lead any honorable senator to import into any debate which may take place to-day any of. that bitterness which, unfortunately, marked some of yesterday&#39;s proceedings. But I do feel that I am entitled to ask honorable senators to extend to the Government the ordinary courtesy which has been extended to every Government since the (Commonwealth was founded, and particularly do I again remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that it was on his motion that an adjournment of three weeks was granted when the Watson Government took office. </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that if I were judge in the case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would find that I should allot him a much longer term than that. We are asking for an adjournment of three weeks, and it is impossible for any one to say that that is a moment too long. Even honorable senators on the other side said they regarded the proposal as a. reasonable one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> said that he could not oppose my motion on the ground of unreasonableness. Some honorable senators said that, having a policy already formed, we ought to be able to meet Parliament in a day. Others said that we had no policy, and that, therefore, any time occupied in an attempt to formulate one would be time wasted. </para>

            <para>- That reminds me of the fact that the late Government had to depend on my help, and on the help of my honorable friends on this side, to get them into recess. We sat up here all night to save the late Government - from whom? From those redoubtable representatives of Queensland, Senators Turley, Givens, and Stewart. I say that but for the assistance of honorable senators on this side, the late Government would never have got their Estimates through. These are the gentlemen who object now to a fair and reasonable demand. The members and supporters of a Government who took six months in which to formulate their policy now deny to the present occupants of the Treasury Bench the very much shorter period of three weeks. I am not asking for any concession from honorable senators opposite. What I am asking for the Government&#39; in this motion is what any fair and reasonable Parliament would grant to any new Administration.. If honorable senators on the other side are determined to refuse it, they can do so. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>(South Australia) &#91;2.44&#93;.- I have no intention to move an amendment on the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council today. My reason is that in another placehonorable members have decided to adjourn for three weeks. Most &#39;honorablesenators will agree withme that honorable members in another place having adjourned for three weeks it would berather absurd for us to adjourn for only a fortnight. It would be more reasonable to adjourn for a monthhere if in another place they adjourned for three weeks. But I should like to remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council that there has twice been failure to obtain a quorum of his supporters to discuss his motion, that it is only with the assistance of members of the Opposition  that it can be discussed, and that if it went to a vote to-day it is very questionable how the numbers would turn up. I am putting these facts before the honorable senator to show him that we are not following our present course from any factious spirit, but in order that the honorable senator and his colleagues may know that they will have to be here if they wish to do business in the future. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to refer to a remark which was made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The honorable senator has rather a habit of trying to put upon one&#39;s words a construction that is not warranted, and of attempting to prejudice one by twisting words that have been used to mean something that was not intended. When the honorable senator just now was referring to public decency, I interjected that public decency required that we should g_et this Parliament to the people at the first opportunity. By inference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> tried to twist that into a reflection by me upon  His Excellency  the Governor-General.  His  words could only be regarded as an attempt to do that. I am sure that in his calmer moments the honorable senator would give me credit for knowing better than to endeavour to reflect upon the Governor-General, either here or outside. He knows very well, as do those who cheered his remarks, that no such inference was to be drawn from what I sa:id. </para>

            <para>- I was attending to mv correspondence. I was quite willing to allow the honorable .senator and his pious colleagues the privilege of listening to the reading of the prayer. I knew that he would be present, because he needs praying for very badly. The present situation would seem to indicate that honorable senators who have combined to form what is known as the Liberal-Tory party, or the Free- trade- Protectionist party, do not desire to proceed with the business of the country at all, notwithstanding that they have raised a continual clamour that Parliament should be called together earlier than usual this year. Why are not the Government prepared to proceed with the consideration of business? Surely a fortnight was a reasonable adjournment to allow them, especially in view of the fact that when the Fisher Government took office it was granted a- respite of only eight days. Seeing that honorable senators opposite have repeatedly declared that it was necessary that Parliament should be called together early this year, in order that it might demonstrate the loyalty of our people by pre.senting a <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> to Great Britain,  I  ask - Why has that proposal now been dropped? Why have not the Government submitted a motion in favour of the course which they advocated so strenuously six or eight weeks ago? Why has this matter been permitted to sink into insignificance? Who has strangled it? Who wishes to thrust it into the background? Why, honorable senators opposite. They merely desired to use their professed loyalty as  a  lever with which to oust the Fisher Government. Directly their greed for office had been satisfied, they dropped the <inline font-style="italic">Dreadnought</inline> proposal as they would a hot potato. </para>

            <para>- I am pointing out as a reason why- the Senate should not adjourn for three weeks, that the country is entitled to know whether my honorable friends opposite were really sincere in their professions of a short time ago. It is also entitled to learn at the earliest possible moment what are the intentions of the Government. I have always objected to lengthy adjournments of the Senate. An adjournment for three weeks will be useless to me, because it is not sufficiently long to enable me to return to my home and to remain there for more than two days. As a matter of fact, I could not leave Melbourne until Wednesday next, so that the proposed adjournment is absolutely useless from my stand-point. But seeing that the Ministry are determined that the Senate shall adjourn for three weeks, we have a right to enter our protest against the adoption of that course, so that upon a future occasion they may be a little more reasonable and treat the legitimate wishes of honorable senators with a little more respect. </para>

          <para class="block">I wish, in connexion with that motion, to intimate to the Senate the proposals which the Government venture to submit for the business during the present session. I need hardly remind honorable senators of the fact that, ordinarily speaking, Government proposals are submitted through the medium of a Governor-General&#39;s speech. That course not being open to the present Administration, I can only fall back upon the one I am now adopting, and indicate in as brief terms as possible the measures which the Government propose to submit for consideration this session. I shall endeavour to complete my task as promptly as possible, and honorable senators will see at once that I shall be assisted to that end if I am allowed to proceed without interruption. </para>

        <para>The most complex series of measures to be submitted includes those affecting the Industrial interests of the Commonwealth. The pivot of several of these will be found in a Bill for the establishment of an Inter-State Commission, which, in addition to exercising the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, will also be authorized to undertake many of the valuable functions discharged in the United Kingdom by the Board of Trade, such as a general oversight of production and exchange, supplying information in respect to markets and openings for trade abroad, and for the improvement and extension of Australian industries within our borders. </para>
        <para>Among its duties will be those of a Federal Labour Bureau, comprising a study of unemployment and of a scheme for insurance against unemployment. </para>
        <para>The Commission will also assist in supervising the working of the existing Customs </para>
        <para class="block">Tariff in its operation upon the investment of Australian capital and labour in Australian industries, advising the removal of any inconsistencies in its schedules, and also with the further view of developing Preferential and other trade relations within the Empire. </para>
        <para>In the meantime any anomalies that may be discovered in the Customs Tariff Act lately passed by this Parliament, will be examined, classified, and dealt with in due course. </para>
        <para>Any divergencies between industrial conditions in the several States which occasion an unjust competition between Australian industries in different States will be adjusted by the Inter-State Commission, with, of course, due regard to all the interests affected, whether or not the unjustly competitive rates exist under the authority of local industrial tribunals. Correspondence is now proceeding with the State Governments in respect to the procedure to be followed in order to endow the Commission with this power. </para>
        <para>An Agricultural Bureau, associated with the Commission, will be established in order to employ the latest scientific means of co-ordinating and extending the good work of the State Departments. </para>
        <para>An active policy of Immigration will be undertaken, and will be expanded in the light of the knowledge made available by the Commission and the Bureau, and with, it is hoped, the co-operation of all the States. </para>
        <para>The appointment of a High Commissioner in London with a well-equipped office will be necessary for, among other purposes, our financial interests, the supervision of immigration, and co-operation with the Inter-State Commission in fostering trade and commerce. </para>
        <para class="block">In this connexion an endeavour will be made to cheapen the cable charges between Australia and the Mother Country, to extend the mail services, and to fully utilize in a Federal spirit the new facilities provided under the contract about to come into force. </para>
        <para>To permit a better discharge of the national responsibilities of the Commonwealth, your authorization will be sought for the acceptance of the Northern Territory. </para>
        <para>Among the first proposals of the Commonwealth Treasurer is that embodied in the Bill, of which notice Bas been given, for amendments of the Old-age Pensions Act. </para>
        <para>This measure, by temporarily suspending the requirements as to naturalization, will permit all old residents of Australia, otherwise qualified, to secure a pension by obtaining letters of naturalization prior to the end of the year. </para>
        <para>The second important feature of the measure is a reduction of the minimum qualifying period of residence in Australia from twenty-five years to twenty years  -  a concession which will, no doubt, be highly appreciated by the old residents whom it affects. </para>
        <para>Bills providing for the Compensation of Seamen, the Prohibition of Inequitable Rebates by Trusts and Combines, for the amendment of the Post and Telegraph Act 1 90 1, and the Patents Act, together with measures consolidating on a Federal basis the laws relating to Bills of Exchange, Bankruptcy, and Marine Insurance, all of great value to the business community, will be brought forward.- </para>
        <para>The negotiations in London, in 1907, concluded early last year, allowing the Coinage for the Commonwealth of an Australian Silver Currency, have been completed. In order to avoid further delay in securing the considerable profits thence accruing, a requisition for the new coinage has been despatched. </para>

        <para>Colonel Foxton, who has been appointed to represent the Government at the forthcoming Conference in London, will take advantage of this opportunity to consult  the  Admiralty upon the whole question of Imperial Naval Defence, and particularly is to the Marine Defence of  the  Ports and Coasts of Australia by the most effective vessels, manned and officered, as far as possible, by Australians trained to the standards, and sharing the opportunities of the Royal Navy. </para>
        <para>The construction, at suitable sites in protected ports, of the necessary docks, shipyards, , and coaling facilities, will also be proposed in the light of the latest data available. </para>
        <para>The policy of the Government in regard to Land Defence will be founded upon the principle of universal training, commenced in youth and continued towards manhood. A Bill for this purpose will be introduced founding the system in the schools, where immediate preparations will be made to qualify Senior Cadets and increase the </para>
        <para>Efficiency  of the Forces of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>The success of a national scheme of discipline must depend upon the efficient training of a sufficient number of officers chosen for their natural aptitudes and capacity to command. A Military College, as well as a School of Musketry, and probably a primary Naval College, will be established to meet this end. </para>
        <para>For the general development and disposition of our adult citizen soldiery, the counsel of one of the ablest and most experienced Commanders of the British Army will be sought. </para>
        <para>Provision for local supplies of Small Arms and Ammunition is being pressed forward, in order to diminish dependence of the Commonwealth upon consignments from oversea. Tenders for an Ammunition Factory, and also for a Small Arms Factory, will be accepted as soon as possible. </para>

        <para>This being the last session of the present Parliament, it is necessary, not only to make provision for the current financial year, but to forecast the near future, and its problems, in order that the outlook may be made clear to all before the coming general election. </para>
        <para>In addition to the ample provision required for Defence purposes, and for the industrial projects already noticed, the outlay upon the Federal Capital Site, the taking over of Ocean Lighthouses by the Commonwealth, and the construction, when authorized, of the railway line to Western Australia, have to be borne in mind. </para>
        <para>A principal departmental outlay will arise in connexion with the works, appliances, and equipment for the services carried on under the Postmaster-General&#39;s control, especially 1hose relating to the telephone branch. A new departure is called for in order to provide for the early construction of necessary reproductive works in connexion therewith. </para>
        <para>In the meantime, the vexed question of the rates properly chargeable for telephonic communication, is being made the subject of expert actuarial investigation. </para>
        <para>Above all, the approaching termination of the ten-year period for which the Constitution provides a distribution of the Customs revenue, marks the close of a critical era, and suggests the pressing importance of this great financial problem. </para>
        <para>A temporary arrangement for a term of years to replace the existing distribution, in which the obligations of the Commonwealth are recognised, is being prepared for submission. </para>
        <para>The future financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth, taken together with their present and future Loan obligations, are being carefully considered in principle and in detail, in order that a satisfactory and permanent settlement may be achieved. </para>
        <para>Communications with the Board of Trade have provided a working agreement upon several important points, which should facilitate the passage of the important measure relating to Navigation now before the Senate </para>

But I wish to congratulate the Government on the shaking-up of the dry bones which seems to have taken place in connexion with this Parliament, and particularly in connexion with the Senate.

I am satisfied that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> nor any other honorable senator need object to an adjournment until to-morrow, because Melbourne is such a pleasant place to live in - especially to those honorable senators who come from Sydney.

This was made abundantly clear by the admission of some of their members that the}&#39; did not regard the motion for a three weeks&#39; adjournment as at all unreasonable, even while they opposed it. Personally I should take no exception to any tactics that they may employ, but I think it is only right that the public should have an opportunity of noting that at the same time that a party is threatening obstruction it clamours loudly that the Government ought to press on immediately with business that it declares to be extremely urgent, but which it yet threatens to obstruct.&#34; </para>

        <para class="block">How ill it comes from the other side to talk in that fashion. Take the last year&#39;s record of the members of the Labour Party. It will be found that there was a difficulty in securing the attendance of sufficient Conservatives to keep a quorum. Out of thirty sitting days last session, some honorable senators opposite were absent seventeen days. I regret that I was not able to be here on the occasion of the last sitting of the Senate. The reason why I was absent was that I was attending the funeral of the late lamented Premier of South Australia, the Honorable Thomas Price. It amazed me to read such base insinuations coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen..</inline> I have considered it to be my duty as a senator, since I wa* elected, always to be in my place if possible. </para>

            <para>- But there are questions as to which it will be my duty to enter an emphatic protest. I allude to such a proposition as that to squander/ perhaps,  .&#163;2,000,000  without consulting the people. If by blocking or doing anything that would be fair I could prevent the carrying of that proposal, then, my God ! it would be my duty to do it. That is my position. But I rose to call the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to his unfair tactics in making this -statement. I wish to remind him that he cannot - afford to play that game. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> now sits by his hide smiling. It is so nice for the honorable senator to have sitting by him the senator who used to fight him. In those days, the Labour Party used to stand between the two of them. But now here they are, sitting side by side, banded together, and have made a sacrifice of their pledges. The Labour Party must be abused, come what may. I say again to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that if nothing else will appeal to him, at least he will recognise that it does not pay for a Minister to indulge in this sort of abuse of a party the members of which have been more regular in attendance than have the members of any other party here. Who kept the old Deakin Government in office? Who assisted the late Government &#39;o pass the Tariff in both Houses ? We see the gallant colonel from New South Wales, v. ho was always a straight-out free-trader, supporting this new Government. Where does the honorable senator stand now? </para>
