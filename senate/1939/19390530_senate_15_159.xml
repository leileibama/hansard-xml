            <para>.- No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> who has had some experience as Postmaster-General, would like to tell my story, but I propose to tell it in my own way. I am merely stating the facts. The approval given by the then Minister for Works has since been overridden or overlooked, and another tender of . &#163;410,776, submitted by H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited, in which provision is made for terra-cotta facings, has been accepted. The story is a long one, and,if necessary, others can follow from where I leave off. There is a difference of only &#163;1,451 between the two tenders, which in itself is somewhat sinister. Moreover, at least one contractor - I am not in a position to say whether there were more - complained that certain influences have been at work outside the jurisdiction of the departmental officers, which, in the language of the street, suggests wire-pulling or underground engineering. These charges are always made against those who accept the responsibility of government, and the surest way in which to prevent such charges, which have been made quite seriously by a member of the Government party in the House of Representatives, is to probe them to their foundations. That is all that I wish to do. Tenders were called in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and by advertisement in the public press; that, I understand, is the usual procedure in order to save time. I want to know definitely whether the department responsible for any given work negotiates direct with private employers in order to ensure a reasonable number of tenders being lodged, or whether they leave this matter to private employers in the hope that they may see an invitation for tenders in the columns of the public press to the effect that certain Commonwealth public works are to be put in hand. If it is the practice of the heads of the departments concerned to interview certain contractors I want the names of the departmental officers and also the names of the firms interviewed. They may not have done this, but I cannot believe that a Commonwealthcontract costing approximately &#163;500,000 is merely advertised in the public press and that the department interested simply depends on private contractors to see the advertisement in some obscure corner of a more or less prominent newspaper. I want to know exactly what the department does in order to call attention to these jobs? </para>

            <para>. - While the debate was proceeding in the House of Representatives, a prominent Minister - and this I suggest is the sinister aspect of the whole business - told the House that it had been discovered that terra cotta could be produced more cheaply than had been anticipated, and that the Government had been assured by the contractor in question that it would get the benefit of any reduction of the price for that material. If that is true, all I can say is that it is an entirely new phase of contract practice. I am by no means a suspicious person, but I suggest that it is the easiest thing in the world for a contractor to submit a tender with the proviso that if, later, he can discover some way by which he can reduce his price, the department will get the benefit of the reduction. But has the Government never heard of extras in connexion with large buildings? It is safe to say that in a contract involving the expenditure of &#163;400,000, the amount charged for extras will be stupendous. And does the Minister for the Interior believe that if under the conditions mentioned, a successful tenderer gives with one hand, he will not with the other hand, take back, with considerable addition? I have never been a contractor and have not had practical experence, but I would not be so silly as to be caught with that kind of chaff, nor do I believe that, up to the present, the department has been caught. However, I do know that these were the excuses - they could not by any stretch of the imagination be termed the reasons - for the rejection, by the present Minister for the Interior, of a contract formally accepted by his predecessor, in favour of the tenderer whose terms, we understand, have nowbeen accepted. </para>

          <para>We cannot afford to treat this matter lightly; it will be to our everlasting discredit if we do. Nor must this unsavoury business be glossed over by silence, or a hush-hush attitude on the part of the departments concerned. Thehonour of this chamber and of every indi- vidual member of it is involved. This is particularly true at the present stage in Australian affairs. Practically every newspaper is demanding publication of the reason why this thing should not be thoroughly investigated. No member of this Parliament, regardless of party affiliations, should allow this matter to rest until he is quite satisfied that nothing dishonourable has been done in connexion with it. Whatever means may have to be taken, however far we may have to go, and whatever delay may be involved in the carrying out of the work, nothing should be allowed to stand in the way until we have put in their proper position the men who have had the handling of this contract from the commencement of the negotiations. I demand to know what is happening, and what has been done in connexion with this business. </para>

            <para>. - I cannot credit the Assistant Minister with being so ingenuous as he would like to appear. He has said that apparently the New South Wales Government is not a supporter of the combine. Does not the honorable gentleman know that the State Government would not have moved hand or foot but for the pressure of public opinion in New South Wales, due to the agitation by Labour members of this and the State Parliament against the excessively high price charged for bricks ? He must know that that Government has never been brought to heel except by pressure exerted from outside its ranks and for which the Australian Labour party has been responsible. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which helps to keep this Government and State Ministers in their jobs, and represents the financial interests  which  provide their election funds, reports that the master builders have admitted that the whole position is serious. </para>

          <para>The Minister for the Interior, to whom this matter was referred last night in Sydney, said that the Government had no knowledge of the prices quoted by sub-contractors to contractors in connexion with the work. The Minister knows as well as I do -that in the case of a contract costing &#163;400,000, contractors and sub-contractors get together and decide the prices for each section of the work. These people are complaining. One firm alleged that Lt had not received quotations from sub-contractors for the supply of sandstone until 40 minutes before the closing time for tenders. Of  course  it did not, because Wunderlich Proprietary Limited and the terra cotta combine were on the job. </para>

Additional allegations were made by the same and other speakers, to the effect that the prices of many essential articles were higher than they should be, the consumer suffering from the unprincipled methods of firms concerned only with the making of excessive profits. </para>

          <para class="block">We must know the truth about this business. If what I suggest is true, there exists an unholy combination which is preventing public works and private building operations from being done in the most economical way. That is why I want to know all about it. If some one by nefarious means is getting a rake-off - I go further and say that if some one is getting a rake-off within the law - I want to know, in order that action may be taken to stop it once and for all. We all know that more homes for the .people are urgently needed everywhere. Even in this capital city of Canberra, there is a waiting list of over 400 people. Most of these homeless citizens are in good jobs and are willing to rent houses in order to play their part in the development of this city. They cannot do this because home-building schemes are being delayed or held up owing to the cruel depredations of private contracting firms. But there is a greater evil; I refer to the existence of slum conditions in Canberra and elsewhere. We cannot expect to eliminate these slums by adopting a comprehensive building scheme, owing to the operations of thieving private enterprise companies and racketeers. My final appeal is that the Senate should insist on probing this unsavoury business to the bottom. If we do not act now, if the contract is finalized, we may, after the building is finished, he charged with being accessories after the crime. </para>

            <para>. - The Works Department is in the position of a business firm carrying out work for clients. After the Postmaster-General had decided on a newbuilding, and the Government had approved of its erection, the Works Department was asked to prepare plans and specifications. In due course they were submitted to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department for approval. The subsequent letting of the contract was largely a formal matter. As there has been a good deal of misunderstanding in regard to the contract for extensions to the General Post Office, Sydney, I propose to make a full statement in relation to the letting of that contract to H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited. The building was originally designed on the assumption that terra co&#39;tta would be used for the upper portion of the Pittstreet frontage. </para>

            <para>. - As some doubt existed as to the relative cost of terra, cotta and stone facings, it was decided to invite alternative tenders. Had the price of terra cotta been considered too high, the acceptance of a tender providing for stone could then have been recommended. It turned out, however, that the difference between the cost of terra cotta and the cost of sandstone was small, and consequently a building to be faced with terra cotta was recommended by the Director-General of Works. Tenders were also invited for a building without any facing at all, but the tenders for such a building were relatively so high as to be not worthy of serious consideration. This proposed work was first brought under my notice by the Director-General of Works a few days after I was appointed Minister for the Interior. He referred to a protest by the present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> against the decision of my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby,</inline> to adopt a stone facing for the upper storeys of the building instead of the terra-cotta finish recommended by the Director-General of Works. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I looked into the matter, and advised the Postmaster-General that I agreed with the view of my predecessor that stone should be used. This brought, further strong representations from my colleague, the Postmaster-General. On the receipt of these representations I discussed the . matter again with the Director-General of Works, and examined all phases of the problem carefully. Subsequently, I wrote the following decision to the Director-General : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Confirming our interview  to-day  - when you asked me for an opinion on the J st May as to whether sandstone or terra cotta should be used in the facing of the new General Post Office in Sydney,&#34; I was not then fully acquainted of the&#34; strong representations made by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and experts that terra cotta should be used, and not sandstone. </para>
            <para>After representations being made to me by the Postmaster-General - by whose department the building will be occupied - and in view ot the fact that you, as Director-General of Works definitely recommended on the 20th March, 1039. that the tender of H. G. Whittle &#38; Sons Proprietary Limited for &#163;410,776 for the building with a granite and terra-cotta face be accepted, I now approve of the lowest tender being accepted on the basis of your recommendation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">During my consideration of the problem as to whether terra cotta or sandstone should be U3ed, I had not been approached by any contractor or by any one on behalf of any contractor. I made my decision after I had read again the original recommendation of the Director-General of Works, and, in the light of it, I considered the further strong representations of the Postmaster-General as well as the fact that the difference, in cost was only &#163;1,451 on a contract amounting to &#163;410,000, where the sum allowed by the department for contingencies and unforeseen costs amounted to &#163;15,000. One cleaning of astone-faced building would cost as much as the difference. I emphasize that in all my discussions of this work with the Director-General of Works; I did not know the name of any of the contractors or the prices submitted. When I subsequently looked into the amounts submitted by the tenderers I found that the lowest tender for terra cotta was that of H. G. Whittle &#38; Sons Proprietary Limited, and for stone, that&#34; of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited. For the sandstone finish the tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited was lower than that of H. G. Whittle &#38; Sons Proprietary Limited by only &#163;111. In respect of a terra-cotta finish the quotation of H. G. Whittle&#38; Sons Proprietary Limited is the lower by &#163;755: The tenders of these two firms are very close indeed. All of the other tenders were much higher. </para>
          <para>On considering the matter subsequently, 1 was glad that when I made my decision in favour of terra cotta, I did so without any knowledge of its effect on any contractor, but purely in the light of the information placed before me. After all, it does not matter to me which contractor gets the work, provided he is qualified in every way to be entrusted with a work of such magnitude. In this case, both the tenderers mentioned, and indeed all the other tenderers, are well qualified. </para>
          <para>Unless the basic principle of contracts by public tender is to be departed from, the Government must give the contract to the tenderer who quotes the lowest amount for the work described in the plans, specifications and quantities, provided only that the lowest tenderer is satisfactory and competent to do the work. </para>

            <para>. - In this case the tender of H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited is the lowest received by the department for a building faced with terra cotta, and to that company the contract must be given following the decision to use terra cotta. Accordingly, the company has been advised that its tender has been accepted. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In discussions in the House of Representatives there have been suggestions that a contractor has been allowed to alter his tender. That is not so ; no alteration of any tenderhas been made. It has also been suggested that fresh tenders should be called. There is no need to call for fresh tenders, and indeed it would be unfair to do so, now that the amounts tendered by some contractors have been published. </para>
          <para>I remarked that I had not been approached by any tenderer or on behalf of any tenderer, but it has come under my notice since I made my decision that, both H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited and John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited have complained to Ministers that they were not satisfied that they had been equitably treated by suppliers on whom they depended for quotations to enable them to complete their tenders. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant</inline> complained that he was not equitably treated by the suppliers of terra cotta, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whittle</inline> stated that he was not satisfied that the stone suppliers gave to him a fair deal. From information supplied to me it appears that John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited, one of the tenderers, has virtually a monopoly of sandstone in the Sydney district, and that that company placed other tenderers at a disadvantage through not supplying them with quotations for sandstone until a few hours before tenders closed. Tenders were called on a lump sum price basis, and the lowest tender was accepted on that basis. The fact that individual subcontractors may have quoted varying prices to different contractors is no concern of the Government. It may be that the suppliers of girders,plumbing work, electrical wiring and many other materials varied their prices, but the Government is interested only in the total sum submitted by thecontractor. Any dispute between tenderers as to relative prices quoted to them by sub-contractors is a matter for the tenderers themselves. </para>
          <para>Even if these complaints could be shown to be justified, it would still not be established that loaded quotations had been used by those who received them, in making up their tenders. In any case, the department is concerned only with the lump sum tendered. </para>
          <para>I have touched on these matters only because they have been mentioned in discussion. They had no influence whatever on my decision to use terra cotta, which, as stated before,was made as the result of the original recommendation of the department and the subsequent representations of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. I am satisfied that I acted on just grounds and in a proper way in approving of the acceptance of the lowest tender for a terra-cotta faced building. </para>

            <para>. - Yes, but alternative tenders were invited for a building faced with sandstone, the reason being, as I have already stated, that it was thought well to have prices for an alternative material in case terra cotta should prove to be very much more expensive. Further alternative tenders were invited for a building with no facing at all. The two tenders for such a building were so high that they were not considered when the final decision was being made. &#39; That decision lay between terra cotta and sandstone, the difference between the lowest tenders being only &#163;1,451.

            <para>.- This debate has afforded me an excellent opportunity at least to deal with one individual who, up to the present, has had a very fair run. I am not suggesting dishonesty against any Minister in connexion with this matter. It is only fair to recognize that with any change of government some muddling and misunderstandings may occur between Ministers and permanent heads. I am prepared to say that some misunderstanding may have occurred in this case. But doubts have arisen, and I suggest an inquiry into the matter would not be a very long job. I feel sure that such an investigation would result in general satisfaction not only to members of the Parliament, but also to the people outside. I repeat that this motion has become necessary, particularly as in the House of Representatives the Government acted unwisely in placing a motion on the subject at the bottom of the notice-paper. I believe that doubts have been cast on some of our officers or Ministers, and these doubts should be cleared up. I trust that the Government will consider the matter further. </para>

              <para>- Throughout the honorable senator&#39;s speech nasty implications were made by using the words &#34; if &#34; and &#34; but &#34;. Vague references were made to outside influences. The honorable senator drew inferences without any knowledge of the subject. To me it was a case of putting the cart before the horse. The honorable senator had no information other than that gathered from what are perhaps doubtful sources. By the use of the words &#34; if &#34; and &#34; but &#34; he cast many nasty aspersions on the manner in which tenders had been handled by various Ministers and departmental officers. I suggest that the honour of Parliament would best be preserved by honorable senators making sure of their facts before making any allegations in this chamber. </para>

          <para>Let us examine the position as it was. I admit that my opportunity of knowing the facts is no greater than that of other honorable senators, including those opposite. We were not supplied with <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports in Sydney of the questions relating to this matter asked in the House of Representatives last week. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> has made a statement which clearly sets out the facts in relation to this matter. From that statement, I gathered that specifications were prepared by the departmental officers in accordance with the requirements of the PostmasterGeneral&#39;s Department, which will pay for, and occupy, the premises when completed. The departmental officers who prepared the specification preferred a building with terra-cotta facing. </para>

            <para>. - The then Minister for Works approved of the tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited. I admit that he conferred with the PostmasterGeneral. When the matter went to the then. Minister for Works in March, he decided, on his own initiative, and, in my opinion, quite wrongly, that the tenders had been wrongly dealt with by the authorities handling them, and that sandstone should be used for the facing of the building. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Then there was a change of government, and a re-allotment of portfolios. I am stating the facts as I understand them, in accordance with what has been said in this chamber this afternoon. The departmental officers then brought under the notice of the present Postmaster-General the recommendation of its experts in favour of terra cotta, and he, rightly or wrongly, approved of their recommendation. I take it that the Minister responsible for the work - the Minister for the Interior - agreed with the Postmaster-General, with the result, that there was unanimity of opinion on the part of the Ministers and the experts. </para>

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition makes many rash statements, and he apparently cannot conceive of another member of this chamber statins the plain facts. The whole of the handling of the tenders shows that terra cotta was favoured because the extra cost was negligible. The tender submitted by John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for a building with a terra-cotta facing was &#163;750 in excess of a similar tender by H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited. </para>

            <para>. - But the Government did not know that. No doubt either firm could have carried out the contract satisfactorily, but, as the tender of H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited was &#163;750 lower, it was rightly accepted. I see nothing improper in the action taken by either the Postmaster-General or the present Minister for the Interior. The Postal Department should, in the main, decide the kind of building to be erected, and the facing to be used. Without being unkind to any former Minister or to the present Ministers concerned, I venture the opinion that they are not competent to say which type of building is most suitable for the requirements of the Sydney General Post Office. The experts in the department - the officers who prepared the specifications - are those who should have the deciding voice. Both the Postmaster-General and the Minister for the Interior should have been guided by their advice. I regard it as wrong for a Minister, however good his intentions may be, to approve of work not recommended by his departmental experts. </para>

              <para>- I shall tell my story in my own way. It was suggested to me that all was not quite as it should be. I was asked by a certain person to make inquiries into the matter, and I remarked that it would be best to enlist the services of a Sydney member for the purpose. I approached a member of the House of Representatives, and asked him to make certain inquiries. He informed me later that he had been unable to find out much about .the matter, but that the tender for a building with terra-cotta facing had been accepted. In these circumstances it seems to me that an inquiry would be justified. I make no charge against H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited or any other firm. What has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> has been reported to me also. Viewing the position in the light of all the circumstances as I know them, either the former Minister for Works or the Minister for the Interior is in the wrong. When there is a doubt in the public mind, and when private persons are making statements which reflect adversely upon a public department, an inquiry should be held. A large expenditure of public money is involved, and these charges should not remain unanswered. If they were brought forward by irresponsible persons we could afford to ignore them, but, since they are made by men occupying responsible positions in the House of Representatives and outside this Parliament, they are worthy of notice. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> himself would have everything to gain and nothing to lose by an inquiry. </para>

            <para>ON. - I am amazed to find that the expenditure of such huge sums is governed by ministerial responsibility or prerogative, because in most of the States tenders of the magnitude of this one are submitted to tender boards consisting of responsible officers. When a State Minister signifies formal acceptance of a tender, it is usually on the recommendation of expert advisers, and the Government would probably have knowledge of whether, as in this case, a facing of terra cotta or sandstone was the more desirable. The Government, or a tender board, should have decided the nature of the construction before inviting tenders. There is no reason why a Commonwealth Government should call for alternative tenders. A house builder whose financial resources are not unlimited may call for alternative tenders in order to enable him to determine what type of construction he can afford, but a Commonwealth Government need not quibble over a mere &#163;1,400. The department should make up its mind asto the form of construction before tenders are invited. </para>

          <para class="block">I understood from this statement of procedure, that the responsibility for recommendations, at all events, rested on the senior officers of the department concerned. Apparently this it not so. From what has happened lately, it would seem that much depends upon who happens to be the responsible Minister, or what government is in power. In this case, if the Lyons Government had. lasted a little longer, the contract for the erection of tho Sydney General Post Office would, no doubt, have been finalized by the PostmasterGeneral immediately preceding the present holder of that portfolio. To my mind, there is something wrong with the system under which a contract for work involving the expenditure of over &#163;400,000 depends upon who is the responsible Minister at the time. </para>

            <para>ON.-I do not think that it is. In all British communities continuity of government policy in respect of some matters is expected, notwithstanding changes that may take place in the personnel of the ministry. There has not been this continuity ofpolicy in connexion with the Sydney building, although ten members of the Lyon3 Ministry are in the present Government. I believe that it would be in the interests of the Government, of contractors, and of the public generally if the procedure outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan were applied to all requirements of the Commonwealth departments, including postal buildings. It is not fair to expect a Minister of his own knowledge to be able to determine whether a building should be faced with terra cotta or sandstone. I admit that if the decision had rested with me, a layman possessing ordinary knowledge of everyday affairs, my choice would have  been for sandstone in order to ensure conformity with the existing building. I would emphasize that after the closing date for tenders <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby,</inline> who was then Minister for Works, definitely approved of the acceptance of a tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for a building faced with sandstone at a cost of &#163;409,325, that tender being the lowest received. </para>

I am aware, of course, that I shall not be allowed to say anything about the Brisbane Post Office. Such a reference would bring me into conflict with the Chair, and I do not wish to run into trouble, because to-morrow I wish to take part in the discussion of another motion relating to these matters. If there were full inquiry into the procedure in relation to public tendering, private contractors would not be able to do as they please; they would be forced to play the game especially in respect of their treatment of employees. On this point I thoroughly endorse the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> I have had considerable experience as a labour organizer, and I know how many contractors, in order to increase their own bank balances, take advantage of the economic disabilities of workers. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> argued that if the department preferred terra-cotta facing for the building, terra cotta it should be. Clearly the trouble is not about the amount involved, because the difference between the prices is, I understand, only &#163;1,451. The fact is that the department wanted terra cotta,&#39; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> preferred sandstone. With the change of government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> became Postmaster-General and said &#34; terra cotta &#34;. I do not know whether that honorable gentleman is using terracotta facing for the new and beautiful home which he is building on a site overlooking Sydney Harbour. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> declared for sandstone, but, being an impartial gentleman, he responded to pressure which was brought to bear upon him in the way of representations with regard to the respective merits of sandstone and terra cotta, and finally he declared in favour of the United Australia party and terra cotta as opposed to the Country party and sandstone. Thus we have had all this storm because the Country party broke with the United Australia party. This dispute and the disclosure of details in connexion with the contract show the length to which profitmongers among private contractors will go to secure their ends. If the workers did what these contractors do almost every day of the week, they would probably be arraigned before a court and charged with some misdemeanour. Perhaps they would be made subject to the &#34; dog-collar &#34; act. But the contractors and their friends can do all .those things with impunity. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">This dog fight between the contractors is interesting to the workers. It has brought out the fact that one contractor has a monopoly of certain materials. We have been told - I believe by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Grant, the principal of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited, one of the tenderers, has a monopoly of sandstone and can make it extremely difficult for other tenderers to compete with him. Other tenderers were thousands of pounds above the offer of this firm. The disclosures arising from the quarrel between the contractors provide the workers with evidence of what goes on. Apparently, terra cotta is a monopoly of Wunderlich Limited. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the organ of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley once described as the &#34;guilt spurred roosters &#34;, the makers of terra cotta showed a certain amount of favoritism. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant</inline> is reported to have said -  &#34; The terra cotta,&#34;he said, &#34; can be supplied only by Wunderlich Limited, and is the monopoly of that firm. The price quoted by that firm to John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for the supply of the terra cotta was &#163;13,150, whilst for the same quality and quantity of material the price to H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited was &#163;10,522, a difference of &#163;2,632 against John Grant and Sons.&#34; </para>

            <para>.- The answer of Wunderlich Limited to that charge is most interesting and enlightening. The manager of that highly moral firm stated thatthe firm made a discrimination in quotations to building contractors who were sandstone merchants and those who were not -  &#34; The price quoted to the firms of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited, and Beat Brothers Limited, both of whom have controlling interests in sandstone quarries, was &#163;13,150,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> said, &#34;the price quoted to ten other contractors, who are not interested in stone quarries, including H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited, was identical at &#163;10,522. The difference in these quotations was admittedly to secure the contract for terra cotta instead of sandstone.&#34; </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">In that statement we have evidence of a struggle between monopolists in order to obtain a certain contract. I do not know whether the Commonwealth Government supports monopolies, but my leader has pointed out that the present government in New South Wales does. We have here an example of the way in which monopolies work. There is a deliberate discrimination by one monopoly against certain contractors who erect buildings of sandstone, and similar discrimination by a competitor against the users of terra cotta. This most interesting situation should be studied by every worker in Australia. </para>

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition spoke of  private  interests conflicting with the public interest. What, did he mean except that in regard to this transaction the private interests of one or more Ministers conflicted with the public interests ? He has no evidence to support such a charge. I say that it is wrong for an honorable senator to make such accusations without bringing forward evidence in support of them. The honorable gentleman said that terra cotta is the product of one monopoly. What has that to do with the matter, unless it be that ho suggests that one or more Ministers are connected with that monopoly ? </para>

            <para>. - I have not had an opportunity to peruse it. My remarks are directed to the explanation given by the Minister to-day, which conflicts with that given in the House of Representatives by the former Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby.</inline> Which am I to accept as correct? I have heard itsaid that contracts were altered. That has been denied by the Minister this afternoon. Like his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> I have no doubt that, if he held ministerial office, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> would acquiesce in everything submitted to him by departmental heads. I feel sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> ever reaches the exalted office of Minister of the Crown, the departmental heads will welcome him. The Parliamentary Standing Committee was established to inquire into matters such as this. Why was not this alteration of the proposed plans for the facing of the building referred to that body? Honorable senators are not able to decide what are the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, who says that no member of this chamber is competent to give a decision as to whether the building should be faced with terra cotta or sandstone, does not know which side he stands on. We know that the former Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> made a certain decision in regard to it after considering the representations made by departmental officials. I have no doubt that he took fully into consideration the extra cost of maintenancethat the use of sandstone would entail. I make no insinuation against the present Minister for the Interior when I saythat, in my opinion, the question of the cost of maintenance was an afterthought, and that the real conflict of opinion was in regard to the tenders submitted. My only interest in this matter is to preserve the honour of this Parliament. I believe that if SenatorWilson&#39;s criticism of the Leader of the Opposition was inspired by motives of fairness, he should vote for this motion in order that the whole facts might be disclosed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> stated his views very emphatically, and I am just as much entitled to accept them as those of the Minister. He said that if he were a Minister of the Crown he would approve of the recommendations of his expert officers. On the contrary, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald says that no honorable senator is competent to express an opinion regarding the relative merits of sandstone and terra cotta. When such conflict of opinion exists among honorable senators opposite, what reason is there for opposition to the proposal that the whole matter be referred to the Public Works Committee, a body composed of members of both Houses of Parliament, for inquiry and report? I admit that I am not conversant with what actually took place when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> madehis decision, nor am I conversant with the recommendations of the expert officers; but I should like to know the real reason for altering a decision already arrived at. The Minister for the Interior has said that the original decision was reversed because of the excessive cost of maintenance of a sandstone facing. </para>

            <para>.- I have had occasion to discuss this aspect of public contracts with the Works Director in Perth. At present certain contract work is being carried out for the Government at Carnarvon by an Afghan who was formerly on the dole. The fulfilment of even a small contract requires a certain amount of capital. The Government should inquire how this man, who was formerly on the dole, was able to finance his contract. There are many ways of evading the law. On occasions I have had to impress upon the Works Director in Perth that, as a responsible officer of the Commonwealth, he has an obligation to see that the clauses of contracts relating to the observance of award conditions are complied with. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is so concerned about the reputation of this Parliament, what possible objection can he have to the holding of an inquiry into this matter? </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">I have submitted this motion because I deem the matter with which I shall deal to be of very great importance, involving as it does the expenditure of &#163;1,000,000 of public money. Half of that sum has already been disbursed in connexion with the purchase of a building site, and the balance is proposed to be used for the erection of a new building to form a part of the Sydney General Post Office. This expenditure at the present juncture seems rather remarkable, in view of the fact that every other kind of public expenditure, however vitally necessary in the interests of the people, and particularly if it refers to any sort of social service, is being avoided, the only explanation offered being that the defence needs of the country are paramount and must have priority. It is also remarkable, in view of the fact that for a quarter of a century there has been a strong demand for a new general post office in Brisbane. That necessary work has been struck off the list because of alleged defence needs. T should like to make it clear that I a in not raising any objection to the construction of new postal buildings. It would delight me if two new post offices were constructed in Sydney, provided they were necessary, and a new  general  post office were built iti Brisbane, and wherever buildings are required for the efficient carrying on of the public service of this country, because of such undertakings a large amount of money is placed in circulation, and there is greater prosperity for those in the community whom honorable senators on this side of the. chamber represent. I do not wish it to be said that I am objecting to the expenditure of public money, because I am not, particularly when such expenditure provides the country with a national asset for many years to come. But the honour of this Parliament is now involved, and the negotiations leading up to this contract are qf vital interest. We are informed almost continually that democracy is on its trial; but one of the surest ways in which to destroy the faith of the people of the Commonwealth in om1 democratic institutions is to allow the honour of Parliament to be assailed without thoroughly inquiring into every charge made. I do not. think that I can be regarded as a  scandaImonger.  I hold that we should not belie  to  too readily those things which ought not to be true. Questions have been asked in this chamber, and in the House of Representatives, as to the position which Ministers of the Crown occupy in connexion with public companies and their shareholdings in such companies. I have before me a very instructive document - I do not propose to read from it this afternoon, because I have not the time - - entitled <inline font-style="italic">Who owns Australia.</inline> I find, however, that prominent Ministers of the Crown in this National Parliament hold a pretty considerable slice of Australia, but I shall have more to say on that point on some other occasion. Certain facts are in the public mind, and the negotiations associated with this contract must be probed to the bottom, regardless of those who may suffer. I shall Fie overjoyed if no one suffers; if it can be shown that nothing dishonorable has been done, and that no member of the Government has placed himself in a position where there is a conflict of interests. I am anxious only to elicit the facts. In connexion with the erection of additions to the Sydney General Post Office, alternative tenders were called for a building with a. granite facing on the lower portion, and  terra-cotta  facing on the upper floors, and for granite facing on the lower portion and sandstone facing on the upper floors. We all know what granite and sandstone facings are, but I arn not sure that all honorable senators know what terra, cotta actually is. lt is not the ordinary product, of the brickyard. It is an exclusive production of one Australian firm which is, definitely, a dangerous monopoly. &#34;I am bound to say, in justice to the ex-Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> that he did his joi) in this connexion thoroughly. I do not agree with all that that gentleman has done, but I am certain that at least he never errs on the side of lack of thoroughness in anything that he undertakes, and he did not err oh this occasion. He consulted the Director-General of Works and carefully examined all the tenders, of which Ibelieve there were about a dozen. A sub-committee of Cabinet was then formed, consisting of the then PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> the then Assistant Minister, now the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> and the then Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby).</inline> That sub-committee studied the tenders very carefully, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby,</inline> as Minister for Works, recommended the acceptance of the tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for &#163;409,325. The present Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> later arrived on the scene. Meanwhile, certain things had happened - certain changes had occurred - which had nothing to do with the tenders, but which have a great deal to do with the politicalmanoeuvrings which had been going on in the interim. </para>

          <para>.- I support the request of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> for an &#34;investigation of this matter. The desire of the Opposition in the House of Representatives to have this matter thoroughly discussed was evaded bv the Government placing a motion relevant to the contract well down on the business paper. Therefore, some action in this chamber has become absolutely imperative. An inquiry would clear the air. Whatever comes out of this motion in this Senate or a similar one in the House of Representatives, a stigma will rest on some members of the Government. I agree with my leader that we should be careful to prevent a repetition of such a happening as that which we are now discussing. After all, we look to responsible members to do things in a proper way. It may be that some misunderstanding has taken place, or some wrong direction has been given, but it is due to the electors of the Commonwealth that the whole matter shall be cleared up. I see no reason why the Government did not agree to the reference of this matter to the Parliamentiary Standing Committee on Public Works. I suggest that the inquiry should go further than has been suggested by my leader. It is not only a case of settling the dispute between John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited and H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited. I want to know why the Government did not know that an individual connected with H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited is a well-known breaker of industrial conditions in the Australian Capital Terri tory, and that his operations here havebeen the subject of complaint bv four of the leading unions in Canberra, and have been brought prominently under notice by the Trades Hall Council. I wish it to be known that this man is one of those who undercut other contractors by reason of the fact that he is the sort of man who prevents his employees from getting their holidays and enjoying the leave conditions granted by the award. I have no desire to say anything which may injure him. I merely wish to draw attention to the fact that his methods have been brought under notice. He has been granted large contracts by the Government, one of the biggest being the construction of the Canberra High School. The departmental officials should know - if they do not they are not worthy of their jobs - that this contractor is accused of seeking in every despicable way to evade the awards which operate in this Territory. If the inquiry suggested by the Leader of the Opposition be undertaken, these activities of H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited should be considered. This Government stands, as does the party to which I belong, for arbitration and the observance of the award conditions. If this contract for the extension of the&#39; General Post Office buildings in Sydney is given to this man, the industrial conditions will be easier to police there; but I do not believe that even there he can be prevented from doing the sort of things he has been able to get away with in Canberra. </para>

          <para>. -  I should not have spoken in this debate had  Lt  not been for some of the remarkable statements made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pollings).</inline> I admit that the honorable senator spoke without knowledge, and that in stating his case he had an exceedingly difficult task to fulfil. In his opening remarks he mentioned that the honour of the Parliament was involved as the result of the way in which tenders had been handled. He went on to say that, if departmental officers gave certain tips by way of information to contractors that was entirely wrong. With that we all agree; but the honorable senator did not even say that suggestions of that kind had been made.  His  whole speech was punctuated by &#34; ifs &#34; and &#34; buts &#34;. </para>

        <para>SenatorDEIN.- The fact that the Leader of the Opposition denies that statement does not necessarily prove its inaccuracy. However, as the cost of terracotta facing might have proved prohibitive, alternative tenders were called for a similar building with sandstone facing on the Pitt-street frontage. When tenders were received, the difference amounted to &#163;1,451, and, when the departmental officers saw such a slight difference, they were, I presume, pleased, and immediately decided in favour of a building faced with terra cotta. Unfortunately, the then Minister for Works, on his own initiative, decided that the departmental officers were wrong, and that their recommendation should not be accepted. Accordingly, he approved of a sandstone facing. </para>

          <para>. - Before debating this matter further I suggest that we should hesitate and do a little clear thinking. How many members of this chamber are in a position to know exactly which would be the better contract to sign - that forsandstone or that for terra-cotta facing? The point that has been exercising my mind is the suspicion that has been created in the minds of the public by the fact that the first decision in favour of one tenderer was later reversed in favour of another tenderer. The position should be clarified. There is no reason why the Government should not accept the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and allow the matter to be fully investigated by the Public Works Committee. I have not the slightest doubt that there is no justification for any suspicion against Ministers or heads of departments. If, as I believe, everything is perfectly clear and above board, why should there be any disinclination on the part of the Government to permit that committee to investigate the tenders and report to Parliament? </para>

          <para>. - In following the debate on this motion I have been struck most forcibly with the light and easy manner in which over ?400,000 can be obtained to make additions to the Sydney General Post Office, when, for ten years, . the erection of post offices in country districts has been deferred owing to an alleged shortage of funds. Apparently, there is no difficulty in acquiring an expensive site to increase the accommodation at the Sydney General Post Office, and to make available over ?400,000 for a new building. There is no difficulty whatever in accepting tenders involving huge amounts, or even in changing the contractor, when there is a change of ministry. The action of the Government amazes me, particularly when I recall the brokendown, ant-eaten wooden buildings serving as post offices in many of the important out-back centres. Hardly a newpost office has been built in any country district in Western Australia for the last <inline font-style="italic">ten</inline> years. When we ask for a new building we are told that money is needed for defence purposes, but it is easy for the Government to provide a huge sum of money to increase the accommodation in a general post office in the capital city of an eastern State. Tenders are even approved by the Minister before the Government has received the authority of the Treasury. </para>

          <para>. - The debate this afternoon has been extremely entertaining, and I feel sure that the remarks of honorable senators will be read with interest by a large number of people who support the Labour movement. I refer, of course, to the workers. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> all this trouble in connexion with the proposed additions to the General Post Office in Sydney would have been averted if a certain Cabinet Minister had been a rubber stamp. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has told us that the trouble would not have occurred if there had not been a split in the Tory parties supporting the Government; that is to say, if the Country party had continued itsassociation with the Ministry the proposed building would have been faced with sandstone and not terra cotta. Because of this split in the - parties supporting the Government, sandstone went by the board and terra cotta has been accepted. </para>

          <para>. -  I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has  brought&#34; this matter before the House. He has stated that the honour of the Parliament is involved. I think that any accusation, or suggestion, of impropriety on the part of a Minister, is a matter which properly should be brought before Parliament. I agree with the honorable gentleman&#39; that this matter must not be glossed over. Obviously, Parliament is the proper place in which to ventilate a matter of this kind.&#34; I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that the charges which have been made should not remain unanswered. However, the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> has not only given a complete explanation of the facts in relation to this transaction, but also has offered to every honorable senator an opportunity to inspect the documents relating to it. He could not have been more open that he has been. There is no necessity to appoint a select committee. Any honorable senator who thinks that there is something wrong in connexion with this undertaking has a duty and responsibility to himself and to the people; he should investigate personally anything which, in his opinion, might affect the honour of Parliament or of any Minister of the Crown. I very much regret, however, that the Leader of the Opposition, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> should have made accusations under the cloak of privilege, without one tittle of evidence to support them. </para>

          <para>- Although that had some effect on the decision made, the principal reason why terra-cotta facing was preferred, was that the building was originally intended to be faced with terra cotta. After, all, the cost of facing is only small in comparison with the total cost of a building. </para>

          <para>. - I join with other honorable senators in complimenting the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> upon having brought this matter before the chamber, because I feel that, if there is a doubt in the minds of members of the Parliament or of the public with regard to departmental tenders, the fullest publicity is desirable. But the Leader of the Opposition, in submitting his motion, did not long continue on that high plane. He could not resist the opportunity to introduce matters quite irrelevant to that for the discussion of which this motion was submitted. Almost at the outset he referred to social services, which have nothing whatever to do with the letting of tenders for public works. From the subject of social services he went on to that of the Brisbane General Post Office, which can hardly be linked up with the letting of tenders for additions to the Sydney General Post Office. In his speeches the honorable gentleman cleverly contrives to cover a good deal more ground than should be traversed under the terms of the motion before the Chair, but we may expect these little digressions by the Leader of the Opposition, who, no doubt, feels called upon to oppose the majority of the actions of the present Government. It seems to me that the real object of the Opposition in not confining its remarks to the particular matter under discussion was shown by the speech of ihe  Deputy  Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> who immediately went on to speak of the wages and other industrial conditions likely to prevail in connexion with the contract. He expressed fear that the successful tenderer would not observe the award conditions. I point out that clause 21 of the form upon which all such contracts  are let contains all necessary provision for the protection of the workmen employed. I give to the industrial officers of the various organizations credit for their work in policing the awards of the courts. At least one inspector was appointed by a government of the same political colour as that now in office to police the awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and I suggest, with great regret, that breaches of the industrial laws are not confined to any one section. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the discussion of the tenders for the additions to the Sydney General Post Office, it was stated that Wunderlich&#39;s Limited had a monopoly of the terra cotta industry. This is quite true. It was also stated that John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited has a monopoly of sandstone, which is also correct. We then heard a statement that had been published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> who set out to expose the nefarious operations of monopolies. Prior to that, a most astounding accusation was made by the Leader of the Opposition, who charged this Government, and ministries of a similar political colour, with being the supporters of monopolies and the exploiters of the public. When, by interjection, it was pointed out that action against mono.polies had been taken in New South Wales by a government of the same political shade as that in office in the Commonwealth, the Leader of the Opposition had the temerity to say that that Government&#39;s action was due entirely to the pressure of public opinion. It would be difficult to show that the opposition party had made any substantial contribution to the control of monopolies. I direct &#34; attention to the fact  that on three successive occasions when the people have expressed -their opinion through the ballotbox, they have shown in no uncertain manner that they have confidence in the ability of the parties now in office to protect their interests. The Opposition has no cause for exultation over the result of the two latest by-elections. </para>
        <para>The suggestion has been made that the decision in regard to the contract for the additions to the Sydney General Post Office was reversed because  of certain ulterior influences. Honorable senators opposite have said that the accusations are not directed against anybody on the Government side of the chamber; yet the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> was responsible for the reversal of the decision of an earlier Minister for Works. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> that the desire of honorable senators opposite to elicit information is entirely praiseworthy, but it seems to me that they are also anxious to indulge in party propaganda. They want an inquiry to be held, so that they may be able to pose before the electors as the upholders of the rights of the people. My party is just as sincere as that of honorable senators opposite in its desire to preserve the rights of the public in connexion with contracts for public works and all other administrative acts. </para>

          <para>. - The real issue is not whether the new building should be faced with terra cotta or sandstone, but whether there has &#39;been any irregularity in connexion with the letting of the contract. Suspicion has been aroused because newlyappointed Ministers interfered with and vetoed the decision of their immediate predecessors. In consequence of statements published in the press, justifiable doubt has been engendered in the minds of the people&#39;s representatives in this Parliament and of the public throughout Australia. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has proposed a way in which to remove all suspicion. We arc not concerned with the wranglings between past and present Ministers. </para>

That reply was either a mistake or an evasion. &#34;When I asked why the Government would not find the money I was told that it did not believe in the political control of the bank. In its report the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Reform said that, in the event of there being any difference of opinion at any time between the policy of the Commonwealth Bank and the policy of the Government, a free and frank discussion of the situation should take place. It went on to say that, should they fail to come to an agreement, the duty of the Government would be to tell the bank what it must do and that the Government would take the responsibility. That power is vested in the Government by an act of Parliament, but nothing has been done. Whenever I try to get information from the Minister on financial subjects, it is not supplied.

              <para>- The first plank of the Labour party&#39;s platform relates to the Commonwealth control of credit. Arising out of my question is the fact that of the &#163;4,875,000 subscribed, &#163;3,650,000 was hank credit money. The loan was underwritten to that degree. It was not called bank credit money, but that was only another evasion. When a similar question was asked earlier, the Government answered that, by arrangement with the bank, it could not disclose the information. Some years ago, when the late Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> visited Western Australia to try to persuade the people not to vote for secession, he told them of the great losses that would accrue to that State if it seceded from the Commonwealth. Their greatest loss, he said, would be the loss of the Commonwealth Bank. He went on to say that, had it not been for the Commonwealth Bank and the national credit behind it, the private banks would have had to close their doors.- That was perfectly true. A few weeks later at a dinner in connexion with the Royal Show at Sydney he said that he stood foursquare for orthodox methods of finance in relation to the defence of this country. Both statements were true, but what of the Government which has to go cap in hand to get a few pounds for the relief of unemployment or to carry on the business of the State? The banking commission went all round Australia for twelve months in order to gain sufficient information to enable it to present a report. During its inquiries it examined over 200 witnesses, held over 100 sittings, and incurred a total expenditure of &#163;27,000. </para>

              <para>- An unlimited amount. When I speak of lending money free of interest, 1 refer to loans made against the credit of Australia. It would be possible, if necessary, to make &#163;100,000,000 available free of interest in this way; but the Government has determined not to use this system of raising money. Sooner than adopt what it calls an unorthodox system the Government raises money at 3$ per cent, and taxes the people in perpetuity to meet the debt ; but it cannot continue to do so for all time. Only last year income tax rates were increased by 15 per cent, and sales tax by 25 per cent. </para>

            <para>- I agree that a great proportion of those assets are mortgaged. As a matter of fact the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry found that the wheat lands of Australia were mortgaged to the banks and financial institutions of this country to the tune of &#163;161,000,000. Even the great wool-growing industry, about which the honorable senator knows so much, is in the hands of the banks, and the woolgrowers have had to ask the Government for a bounty of Id. per lb. in order to keep solvent. Honorable senators will recall that when wool was sold at lid. a lb., two years ago, lOd. a lb. of the grower&#39;s money was paid away in interest on mortgages. The wool production of Australia for that year was valued at &#163;161,000,000 and nearly all of that money was utilized to meet interest charges. Interest is one of the greatest curses of the world. Of the municipal rates collected in Sydney about 12s. in the pound is paid out in interest. </para>

            <para>- No; I am complaining that we are paying about &#163;1,000,000 a week in interest on that debt. The national debt of the British Empire  prior to 1914 was only &#163;600,000,000, about one-half of the national debt of Australia to-day. Our debt &#34;s being constantly added to by the continuation of the present system of borrowing money. It is a fundamental principle of banking that the banks do not lend deposit? at all. They are not instituted for that purpose. The last report of the Commonwealth Bank Board discloses  that  the whole of the eight big banks in Australia had between them only &#163;17,000,000 wo.-th of notes; the rest of their money was in silver and copper. </para>

            <para>.- Yes. The honorable senator will recall that a fewyears ago they made such an arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank Board when they applied for  increased  credit amounting to &#163;20,000,000. On that arrangement being made they had the right to draw up to that amount.  When the notes were printed, not one bank made application for these notes. If they had taken up any of that credit they would have had to pay 3 per cent, for it. The only occasion on which they would be likely to need the money would be in the event of a run on the bar.ks. But they have been able to lend money against that credit. It is now proposed to issue &#163;3,000,000 worth of  treasurybills.  Those bills will be taken np by the banks, and in their statements will be reckoned as cash. Everybody knows that the banks will be able to&#39; lend eight or nine times the value of the treasurybills they take up. In this way they  monetarize  the real wealth of Australia. The banks have issued credit np to &#163;500,000,090, but everybody knows that there has never been more than &#163;57,000,000 of real money in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> some time ago asked me if I would explain how the banks are enabled to do this. I spent one and a half hours in explaining this matter to the honorable senator. The next day when this chamber was asked to vote an appropriation of &#163;10,000,000,I showed how &#163;10,000,000 worth of credit could be issued free of interest. Yet the honorable senator, in spite of my explanation, voted with the Government to pay 37/8 per cent. for that money. That results from the Senate having degenerated into a party House. It was not intended to be so; its function should be to review what comes before it from the House of Representatives. There is no obligation on any honorable senator to vote for any government which happens to be in power at the moment. Unfortunately, as it now operates, this Senate is a purely party House. If a man goes into a bank to purchase Commonwealth bonds to the amount of &#163;100, the money he pays to the bank never reaches the Treasury; but the bank is able with the cash it receives to buy between &#163;700 and &#163;800worth of&#34; bonds for itself. That is low the banks have been able to underwrite the &#163;3,650,000 not subscribed by the public in the loan to which I referred earlier. This is all bankcreated money. In support of that statement I quote as my authority a former secretary of the British Treasury, who, in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</inline> says, &#34;Banks are institutions for the creation of credit which they create out of nothing&#34;. The whole of the national debt of Australia is due to the banks, and bank-created credit is only an entry in a ledger. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> McKenna, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, said in 1924, when addressing the directors and shareholders of the Midland Bank, of which he was then  chairman  of directors, that every Joan creates a deposit and every repayment of a loan cancels a deposit. The banks not only create money, but also cancel it. The banks are not the intermediary between the lenders, who are the depositors with the banks, and the borrowers. They have created the &#163;3,650,000 worth of money with which they have underwritten this loan. If honorable senators will read down the financial statements of the Bank of New South Wales they will find an item &#34; Deposits, &#163;54,000,000.&#34; I asked a man in Hobart who had had fifteen years experience of banking what that item meant. He said that it represented deposits. I told him that there is only &#163;57,000,000 of real money in Australia, of which there was always about &#163;37,000,000 in the pockets of the people and asked how, if that was so, he could account for one bank having &#163;54,000,000 of deposits. </para>

            <para>. - Ultimately the information had to be given. By hiding its reserves, the Bank of New South Wales is able to keep its dividends down. How can any one tell from a balancesheet how much is being placed in secret reserves? Even as much as &#163;100,000 could be placed in secret reserves and the balance-sheet would show nothing of it.

          <para>I object to the evasive answers which have been given to my questions. In reply to question No. 2, the Minister stated that the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Reform made no finding that the Commonwealth Bank should lend money free of interest. I did not say that ; I said that the commission had said that the hank could. That is merely another -way of evading the question. </para>
          <para>In August, 1914, two days before the declaration of war, when it appeared inevitable that Britain would be involved, there was a run on the Bank of England, and &#163;10,000,000 was paid out in gold in two days. No banking system could stand that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George stated in his memoirs of that eventful week that the Governor and directors of the Bank of England went to the Government of Great Britain wringing their hands and asking for assistance. They said that without some help from the Government every bank in England would be obliged to close. Fortunately for the people of England, war was declared on a Saturday, which was a bank holiday. Every bank was closed by proclamation until the following Thursday, and in the meantime legislation was passed authorizing the Chancellor of the Exchequer to issue fiduciary notes to an unlimited amount. Eventually notes to the amount of &#163;320,000,000 were issued. The &#34; Bradburys &#34; remained in circulation for ten years and met all the requirements of trade and commerce. Of course, when a country issues notes without a gold backing, it goes off the gold standard. In 1924 the Government of Great Britain was asked to appoint a commission to inquire whether the time was opportune to return to the gold standard, and the reply by that body was in the affirmative. Britain took this advice, but could not remain on the gold standard, because industry was being ruined. </para>
          <para>A tremendous expenditure is being incurred in connexion with national defence, and the Commonwealth Bank could, without doubt, issue to the Government, free of interest, almost as much money as it liked. Australia&#39;s heavy interest bill, which amounts to &#163;1,000,000 a week, is strangling it. The security of Australia depends on the finance it can raise for the purposes of defence. The report of the Monetary and Banking&#39; Commission states, at page 196, paragraph 504, that the Commonwealth Bank can issue interestfree money to the Government.&#39; When the Scullin Government assumed office, prior to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer&#39;s visit to Australia, it found that, after ten years of administration by nationalist governments, the Treasury was empty, and that Australia had an adverse trade balance of &#163;30,000,000. The London loan markets were closed to us. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> realized his powers under the Constitution, he could have ignored <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, and instructed the Commonwealth Bank to issue interest-free money. Without legislation, he could have told the bank to issue that credit, but he did not know that that power could have been exercised. </para>

What could have stopped <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> from doing that? Honorable senators opposite know why they are in trouble over the plight of the wheat industry. It is because they will not vote for a change of financial policy in the direction that I have indicated.

          <para>The answer to my question was very incomplete, and not what it should have been. I was informed that the- amount of underwriting subscriptions totalled &#163;3,650,000. That is merely bank-created credit because the money remains in the bank as deposits. Eighty per cent, of any loan raised by the Government is bank-created money. That is why we are paying interest to the amount &#163;1,000,000 a week for money that never existed. The resources of Australia are such that we could create credit next week to the extent of &#163;100,000,000, and thus finance all our defence needs. </para>

              <para>- Anticipation of what may occur later is responsible for my present remarks. I refer to the reported statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that it was expected that both Houses would adjourn on the 9th June. While I am here, I hope that nobody outside the ranks of elected senators will ever decide when this chamber is to adjourn, or what time it is to have for its deliberations on important measures. We have passed  two bills since we met for this period, but the most important bill of the session is still in the House of Representatives. When I asked a Minister to-day how the Government was progressing with its legislation in the House of Representatives, he replied, &#34; The best I can say is that we are holding our own.  We are not in reverse gear &#34;. I cannot see any merit in the proposal of the Government to terminate this period of the present session on the  9  th June. Honorable senators are aware that the measures on the notice-paper in the House of Representatives yet to be discussed include the Supply and Development Bill, the National Registration Bill, the Commonwealth Bank Bill - in which provision is made for the establishment of .a mortgage branch which will be of benefit to primary producers and others - ; and a motion to appoint a committee to determine the best method of electing the Senate. I do not know whether the Government intends to go into recess on the date mentioned, but I trust that sufficient time will be given to the Senate to give adequate consideration to all the measures which are passed by the House of Representatives instead of asking us to rush them through within a day or two. There is no valid reason why the Senate should not adopt the practice of the upper chambers in the State Parliaments although the National Parliament should not have to look to the State legislatures to guide it in the conduct of its business. Honorable senators should be prepared to remain in session for two or three weeks after the House of Representatives adjourns in order to give proper consideration to legislation which the House of Representatives has had ample time to discuss. </para>

In view of the limited opportunities afforded to. honorable senators, I feel that I am justified in referring to this subject at this juncture.  Tit  is not a mere coincidence, but appears to he a part of a deliberate plan to bring this chamber into disrepute as much as is possible, and to pave the way for the establishment of a governing institution similar to those established in other countries. </para>

            <para>.- The Labour party stands for the improvement of the present parliamentary system. Honorable senators opposite favour the abolition of Parliament and the establishment of a dictatorship as was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> when Prime Minister, and more recently by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> who said that the affairs of this country could be conducted satisfactorily by half a dozen astute business men. As winter is now approaching, the position of the unemployed is becoming more acute every day. Men possessing aspirations and obligations similar to our own are starving in the midst of plenty, due,  primarily,  to the indifference or ignorance of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> said that unemployment is a national matter; it is a vital national matter. There is no scarcity of material resources in this country with which to provide a standard of living for the unemployed equal to th,.t which the basic wage provides. There is no scarcity of land, timber, or other materials, and if these were used as they should be the unemployed could live in reasonable comfort. What should be done? Honorable senators opposite and the members of the same party in the House of Representatives contend that the problem of unemployment  is  not the responsibility of this Government; therefore nothing is done. Sympathy is offered, but no practical help is given. On Thursday last a deputation of over 200 men and women representative of educationalists, political parties, municipal councillors, business men, the Chamber of Manufactures, the Employers Federation, and the Trades Hall waited on the Premier of Victoria. At. that gathering, the Premier said that  it  was appalling to see thousands of young men walking aimlessly through the streets every day vainly seeking work. Surely that is a reflection upon those charged with the responsibility of governing this country ! Are governments too incompetent or too indifferent to solve this problem? We are faced with the progressive deterioration of the virile young men of this country, . on whom we have to depend for the production of wealth and for the defence of Australia. After years of experience amongst the unemployed, I can say without hesitation that a deliberate attempt is being made to capitalize unemployment by using the unemployed to keep wages down to the lowest possible level and to raise profits to the highest degree. </para>

            <para>-It is true. Any honorable senator opposite who goes into the question as thoroughly and as sincerely as has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> must admit the accuracy of my statement. Thousands of returned soldiers to whom credit is given for defending Australia overseas during the Great War are living under conditions of semi-starvation, while those who have never suffered or sacrificed are drawing thousands of pounds annually in interest. I am thinking more particularly of young men who are on sustenance, and who are pleading for employment because they wish to become responsible citizens. &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane, Senator Sheehan</inline> and I are interviewed in the Federal Members Rooms in Melbourne daily by hundreds of young &#39;men seeking work. Although we give them letters in the hope of assisting them, we tell them what the position actually is. As a representative of the working class, I would be lacking in my duty if  1  did not demand that the Government depart from its policy of indifference and start works on which these mcn can be employed. I would give to the Government some credit if it made an effort to relievo the situation of these unfortunate men who are being treated as lepers, outlaws, or refugees in their own country. There are over.  40,000  men in Victoria out of work, and I believe that in the whole of Australia there must be over  100,000  who, owing to governmental incompetence, are living in a state of semistarvation. If there were a drought or scarcity of food, something could be said in support of the Government&#39;s inactivity, but we have sufficient material resources to enable every man to earn a decent living. If honorable senators opposite felt as these poor people feel, they would become Communists or revolt. I trust that the Government will take up this matter very seriously in the endeavour to afford some assistance to those who deserve help more than ony other section of the community. It is easy for some honorable senators to smile, but they do not know what it is to be without food and the ordinary comforts of life. Their life is congenial and they have nothing to worry them. Had they to experience what these unfortunate men and women have had to experience, the unemployed problem would soon be only a memory of the past. </para>

            <para>.- I am speaking particularly of the hardships endured by several returned soldiers, because they cannot get work, and because they are unemployable. In some instances, ex-soldiers making application for &#34;a pension are subjected to third-degree methods, and their wives have to suffer the same indignities. Some of the commissioners even had the audacity to ask one woman where she got the dress which she was wearing. </para>

            <para>.- It is not. I am telling the facts as related to me. Returned soldiers who were wounded or gassed in the last war, and who did not make application for a pension immediately upon their return, are now expected to find the men who were beside them when they were wounded or gassed, in order to substantiate their claims. It is almost impossible to do this, because men who were beside them in the war may be dead. Certainly they cannot always be located. This treatment is not calculated to encourage the younger generation to respond to the appeal made by the Government for volunteers for the militia, in order to ensure the defence of this country. I am astonished that exsoldier senators supporting the Government have not protested more forcefully about the treatment meted out to returned soldiers. </para>

            <para>.- I have in mind the different treatment meted out to two brothers who served four years at the front. One, an unmarried man, was wounded. Upon his return, he made application for and was granted a pension.  His  brother, a married man, was twice gassed, and to-day is a confirmed invalid. Unfortunately for him, he did not make application on his return to Australia for repatriation benefits. Now he is. unable to do any work and has been refused a pension.  His  wife sometimes finds him in a state of collapse in the garden. He has made repeated applications for a pension but without success. As a result, his wife has become the breadwinner for the family and she has even been denied assistance in the form of books for the education of her son. The brother, who was unmarried when he enlisted, has since married and has reared a family in what, by contrast with his brother&#39;s economic condition, is a state of luxury. The time is now coming when the son of this married returned soldier, the man who has been denied repatriation benefits, may be called upon to fight for this country, and incidentally, to ensure the security of the children of his father&#39;s brother. The Government should take heed of all these complaints. They come before me every week, and I feel sure that other honorable senators must also be inundated with similar requests for assistance from returned soldiers who are either unemployed or unemployable. </para>

            <para>.- I have inquired into several, and I assure the honorable gentleman that I have not overstated the position. Although the commissioners may not have said so in so many words, a common-sense interpretation of their replies to representations on behalf of some returned soldiers who are now seeking repatriation benefits is that these men must find some one who was with them during the war to support their applications. Of what use will be the Government&#39;s physical fitness campaign if children of returned soldiers are not ensured a reasonable standard of living? This will be impossible if their parents have not sufficient income to provide the necessaries of life. The condition of seme returned soldiers is deplorable. Their claims should have earnest and sympathetic consideration. </para>

              <para>- I have said many times what I believe is the right thing to do, although on this matter I may not be in agreement with some honorable members on my side. I resent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron&#39;s</inline> statement that Ministers and their supporters were rather gratified at the increase of the number of unemployed, because it made possible a lower ing of the standard of living which, according to the honorable gentleman, would lead to an increase of profits in industry. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> can &#34;get away&#34; with a statement of that nature on the Yarra Bank, but he has no right to make it here and expect not to be challenged. It is totally unjustified., and I feel sure that the honorable senator himself does not believe it. We are all much distressed when cases of unemployment are brought to our notice. We are as much concerned as are honorable senators opposite, but we . do not make a show of it. We give a sympathetic hearing to all representations and do what we can. I yield to no one in my sympathy for the working classes. We are all vitally interested in the problems of unemployment. Sympathy for the workers is not the monopoly of Labour senators. I hold that although the Government has done much, it has not done enough and it should not cease its efforts until employment has been found for all those who are willing and able to work. I am grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> for having brought this matter up to-night, because I had intended to raise my voice in protest, and to urge that the Government should do a good deal more than it has done. The latest figures available show that in New South Wales 36,000 men are unemployed, whilst another 1S,000 are engaged on relief work. That the position is better than it was is cause for some satisfaction, but the fact remains that there are still 54,000 bread-winners seeking jobs. It is our duty to do as much as lies in our power to find jobs for them. I should appreciate any suggestions from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and his colleagues for a solution of this problem. </para>

Should any honorable senator opposite offer a suggestion which I  believe to be practicable, I should have no hesitation in giving it ray support. </para>

            <para>. - When ever honorable senators opposite are given an opportunity to play their part, instead of doing so, they invariably cry &#34; the thing is loaded &#34;. On the occasion to which I have referred, the Labour members of the Parliament, and the trade unions, resisted the appointment of a body to undertake the inquiry. Shame on them! I fought for that inquiry in the hope that something beneficial would result, but the Labour party would not help me. Now, as then, it says, &#34; The dice are loaded against us&#34;. We never hear practical suggestions from the other side of the chamber, but only that empty talk which we associate with certain public places where speakers tickle the ears of their hearers. I repeat that if any member of the Opposition brings forward a proposal which appears to offer a solution of this problem, I. shall give to it my earnest consideration, and will support it if it be practicable. </para>

            <para>. - Reference has been made to the Statistician&#39;s  figures relating to unemployment throughout Australia. It is well known that these statistics are, to some extent, based on figures supplied by employers of labour who keep records of the applications they receive from men wanting work. As many such applicants are registered in the books of several employers, statistics based on such returns are obviously unreliable. </para>

          <para>The most tragic aspect of unemployment is the inability of many youths between the ages of eighteen and 22 years to obtain work. In my opinion, they are deserving of our special consideration. These lads are men in the making. On the one hand, they are too old to be employed as apprentices, and, on the other hand, they are not sufficiently trained to command adults&#39; wages. A definite effort should be made to find employment for them. I am confident that if an earnest attempt were made in that direction by the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the State governments, this problem could be solved. Honorable senators know the evil results which frequently follow long periods of unemployment. The Commonwealth Government has a responsibility in this matter, notwithstanding that its constitutional powers are limited. The primary responsibility rests on the States, but the Commonwealth should co-operate with them in an earnest attempt to solve this problem. </para>

              <para>-  I do not think, that they were in keeping with the high tone which usually characterizes debates in tbe Senate. The making of exaggerated statements for political capital is unwarranted. If tbe honorable senator will bring to my notice, or to the notice of the responsible Minister, a particular case of injustice to a returned soldier, he will find that it will receive due consideration. The honorable senator will, I am sure, recognize that the Government is doing everything possible to see that justice is done to returned soldiers. If he makes a comparison with what is done for returned soldiers elsewhere, he will see that  in this respect Australia is more liberal than any other country. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that he should adhere to principles, and not indulge in personalities by suggesting that honorable senators on this side are doing nothing to assist the unemployed. He went so far as to insinuate that we desire unemployment to continue, so that capitalists may fatten in consequence of the misfortunes of the workers. That is not the position, and it is regrettable that an honorable senator should make a long and dreary speech in an effort to make political capital out of such a discussion. He would be well advised to concentrate on constructive remarks, so that something useful might be done for the benefit of the unemployed. </para>

          <para>.- A fortnight ago I asked &#34;upon notice a question concerning unemployment. I wished to direct the attention of the Government to the increase in Victoria since 1st January last, notwithstanding that hundreds of men had been absorbed under the Defence programme. I desired to know if the Government had any long-range plan, corresponding to that of the British Government, for coping, in co-operation with State Governments, with the undoubted increase of the unemployed when its defence programme was finished. The answer to my question was not satisfactory. I expected the Minister to say that the Government <inline font-style="italic">was aware</inline> of the increase of unemployment, and that the Prime Minister, in spite of the Government&#39;s limited powers under the Commonwealth Constitution, would meet State Premiers in conference, in order to come to some workable arrangement for dealing successfully with this vital problem. Instead, I was supplied with statistical percentages over a period of given quarters. The figure, 9.8 per cent., for the last quarter, was slightly higher than that for any quarter in 1938. No doubt that increase was due to the severe drought which Victoria had recently experienced, and the low overseas price for wheat. These official figures are certainly a guide, but not a true indication, of the number of unemployed. They record only the number of trade unionists registered for employment; they do not take into account the number of trade unionists who have drifted into other avenues of temporary or seasonal employment, the thousands of young fellows who never had the opportunity to qualify for admission to a trade union, and hundreds of returned soldiers not on pension who are capable of doing a good day&#39;s work. If, to the official figures, be added, roughly, 38,000, a truer picture will be presented. If that number be reduced by, say, 7,000 persons who are unemployable, due to physical disability or &#34; work-shyness &#34;, it would still be far -too high. What will the position be three or four years hence, when the defence programme is completed, and hundreds are thrown back on to the skilled and unskilled labour market ? </para>

        <para>During the last recess I had brought forcefully home to me the great number of men who are out of work. Over 400, the majority of whom are returned soldiers, sought my assistance in getting employment at the munitions establishments at Footscray and Maribyrnong. I did what I could for them. How many were placed I have no means of knowing. No doubt other Victorian senators were similarly approached, and probably had to listen, as I did, to men in desperate straits, wives pleading for t e husbands, and young men asking for a chance to earn their keep. What is to be done about this problem? Senators opposite claim with all sincerity that a 40-hour week or less is the remedy. Senators of this side, equally sincere and capable of expressing an opinion, hold the view that a shorter all-round working week would only intensify the trouble, and lead the country into greater difficulty. </para>
        <para>Successive federal governments since the depression eight years ago are to be commended for having placed the nation on a sound footing. Tariffs and world prices of wool and lesser export commodities have, of course, contributed to the country&#39;s stability. The official percentages of registered trade unionists out of employment have gradually dropped since 1931 from 32 per cent, to 9 per cent. Numbers of new factories have been established and many big employing enterprises launched. The value of production has increased year by year, yet the latest figures show that in Victoria - a great secondary industry State - about 38,000 men are out of work. The majority are on sustenance. The dole it is termed, but &#34;dope&#34; is a more correct word. Young men are losing the will to work. This Government is doing its part by helping State governments with grants of money to train youths in technical colleges, but the unskilled hundreds - heads of families - are the people about whom I am. concerned. The Commonwealth Government, unlike the British and other Dominion Governments, has not full constitutional powers to tackle this problem single-handed. The finding of employment is primarily the concern of the State governments, yet, in the broad sense, it is a national responsibility. Surely, there is some way of getting round the Constitution, if technicalities bar the way ! There are some big national works which could be undertaken, thereby giving a few months&#39; continuous employment at award rates. The reply will be &#34;no money; all wanted for defence&#34;. Two million or three million pounds off the Defence Vote might easily be allocated for defence against drought and floods. Water conservation and afforestation would absorb the majority of the unskilled unemployed. Somewhere in departmental pigeon holes in Melbourne or Canberra is the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash&#39;s scheme, prepared in 1920, for the conservation of water in the eastern States. Another national work of a semi-defence nature that might be undertaken is the renovation and extension of the Williamstown dock, which is 70 years old, and is the only dock on the southern coastline of Australia. In time of war, when enemy submarines are active, such a modern dock would be invaluable to any coastal vessel limping into port. Sydney is too far .away for a merchant ship disabled by a hostile submarine in southern waters. </para>
        <para>I have dealt with this problem of unemployment because it is a national question, not merely a State matter. It certainly is not a party matter. The Senate is less of a party House than is the House of Representatives. We should demand that the Commonwealth Government and State governments cooperate to do something big to stem the tide of increasing unemployment. I hope that Ministers in this chamber will induce their colleagues in the Cabinet to take some action. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to refer to the Continued absence of business from the notice-paper of the Senate. Although honorable senators were called together again to-day, after an adjournment extending over a period of nearly two weeks, had it not been for the action of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> in moving the adjournment of the Senate to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, it is probable that this chamber would have adjourned within a very short time of its assembling. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has an excellent opportunity to rehabilitate the Senate as the senior House of the federal legislature by insisting that more legislation be initiated in this chamber. I have here a list of Orders of the Day for the House of Representatives. Will any honorable senator suggest that it would be impossible to initiate in this chamber the discussion of electoral law and procedure in relation to the election of senators, or of the long awaited Commonwealth Bank Bill, or of the policy to be pursued in connexion with the development of Northern Australia, or of the annual report of the Tariff Board ? Another outstanding item relates to unemployment insurance and a 40-hour working week. Those subjects could be dealt with, in this chamber. As mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, the attitude of some honorable members of the House of Representatives towards the Senate was indicated a few days ago when a Minister said that he regretted that the Minister holding a certain portfolio was not in that chamber. Surely the Government has sufficient organizing ability so to arrange the business of the Parliament that one chamber is not congested with business while the other has practically nothing to do. Every honorable senator wishes to get on with the job which he was elected to perform, and I, for one, am annoyed when I find that we in this place have constantly to await the arrival from the other branch of the legislature of measures which could as easily be dealt with first in this chamber. I realize that it is difficult for the Leader of the Senate to say when certain measures will reach this chamber from the House of Representatives. I sympathize  with him in his difficulty, but I suggest that he could improve conditions generally by initiating more business in this chamber. I go so far as to say that honorable senators are more Qualified than are most members of another place to deal with some of these subjects. The position into which we have drifted is deplorable. Apart from the motion of which the Leader of the Opposition has given notice, I do not know what business there will be before the Senate tomorrow. I do not say that the Leader of the Senate is incompetent, but I think that he is too soft in dealing with his colleagues in the Cabinet. He should <inline font-style="italic">in?sist</inline> that the rights of the Senate shall not be ignored. After all, the Senate is the senior chamber of the federal legislature. Certain persons have had their way for such a long period in this chamber that honorable senators generally have become accustomed to accepting whatever is done. We on this side wish to see the business of the country attended to properly. We claim that since our numbers have been augmented, we have assisted in the transaction of the business placed before us. Our complaint is that we are not getting sufficient business to get our teeth into. In order to help the Government members have asked numerous questions, <inline font-style="italic">without notice,</inline> or have moved the adjournment of the Senate. We have done our best to let the electors know that the Senate exists. The way in which the business is conducted is such that it is not to be wondered at that members become somewhat disgruntled and critical at times. I am not disgruntled, nor am I unduly critical, but I am concerned for the dignity of this chamber. I suggest that the Leader of the Senate should see the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> with a view to making it possible to have a roster of work for the Senate along the lines followed in the other branch of the legislature. </para>

          <para>. - I draw the attention of the Senate to the evasive and unsatisfactory replies given to questions, which I asked, <inline font-style="italic">upon notice.</inline> This is not the first occasion on which the Government has not given straight answers to straight questions. I was informed to-day that subscriptions to the &#163;8,500,000 loan of February, 1939, totalled &#163;4,875,000, whilst the amount of underwriting subscriptions totalled &#163;3,650,000. If that &#163;4,875,000 had been real money subscribed by the public, the Commonwealth Bank, following the usual practice of banks, could have advanced to the Commonwealth at least &#163;35,000,000 in credit. I was also informed that because of an arrangement with the bank the Government could not give certain information for which I had asked. The Senate is not allowed to know how much real money is subscribed by the public, and how much bank money is subscribed by the banks. Why should not that information be given to us? In reply to my second question, the Minister said - </para>

          <para>. - I direct the attention of the Government to the urgent necessity to liberalize war pensions and thus enable many returned soldiers to receive better treatment than they are getting to-day. During the short time I have been a member of this chamber, I have been amazed at the pitiful stories told to me by &#39;returned soldiers. I do not say that everything I am told is true, but as I knew many of the men before they went to the war and since their return, I feel assured that most of the information given cannot be successfully challenged. As many who are unable to work cannot get a war &#39;pension, their wives are compelled to work to keepthemselves and to help to maintain their husbands and their children. </para>

          <para>. -  If the conditions generally were as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> we should have good reason to feel distressed. But I have some knowledge of the administration of the Repatriation Act, and I assure the honorable gentleman that the cases mentioned by him are covered by that, and alleviation is possible. The honorable senator may have in mind a small minority of hard cases which it may be difficult to cover in the general policy. It is not even fair on bis part to mention particular cases which he has not properly investigated. He stated, for instance, that the commissioners had taken up a critical attitude when approached by wives of ex-soldiers seeking a repatriation benefit. Obviously,, the honorable gentleman could have had in mind only one  deputy  commissioner - the official in his State; yet he recklessly  made a wholesale charge against the commissioners, entrustedwith the administration of the act. If the honorable senator will bring the caseshe has in mind to the notice of the Minister for Repatriation or myself, they will be examined closely and justice will be doneIt is not right for the honorable senator to assume that he is speaking here on behalf of ex-soldiers as a whole, because he is not. He does not know them. </para>

          <para>.- I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> mentioned the subject of unemployment, for, although I do not agree with all that the honorable senator said, I endorse to the full his remarks about the hardship resulting to a great number of people from unemployment. I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that, notwithstanding what it has done directly and indirectly to get tens of thousands of Australians back into employment, the Commonwealth Government will still not have done enough until all who are willing and able to work are in employment. No effort should be spared by either the Common wealth or State governments to see that these men are again employed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> went on to say that honorable senators opposite thought that the solution for unemployment was to be found in a reduction of the working week to 40 hours, and that Government supporters were of the opinion that a shorter working week would intensify unemployment difficulties. I differ from the honorable gentleman. I expressed my views on this subject when I was a member of the House of Representatives and have reiterated them on several occasions since I entered this chamber. I believe that a reduction of hours will partially help solve the unemployment problem. </para>

          <para>. - Probably more time has been devoted in this chamber to the discussion of unemployment than of any other subject. Having listened carefully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> I formed the opinion that the honorable senator believes that the sole responsibility for caring for the unemployed throughout Australia rests on the Commonwealth Government. He also gave the impression that, in his opinion, honorable senators on this side are callous and indifferent to the plight of men who are unable to find work. He even went so far as to suggest that we on this side enjoy seeing the unemployed suffer. I do not say that this Parliament has no responsibility in relation to this national problem, but no honorable senator is justified in exploiting the sufferings of the unemployed for party political purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> comes from Victoria, a State in which the Government is kept in office by the Labour party. The honorable senator knows that, although the responsibility for dealing with unemployment rests primarily on the State governments, the Commonwealth Government has always been willing to co-operate with, the States in finding a solution of the problem. I remind honorable senators that in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia, Labour governments are in office, and that in Victoria the Government is controlled by the Labour party. </para>

I shall bring to the notice of the Minister for Defence the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the advisability of having documents such as this printed in Canberra.

        <para>Several honorable senators have mentioned the matter of unemployment. About a fortnight ago, a deputation was introduced to me in Sydney by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Beasley,</inline> composed of representatives of ironworkers, moulders and various other people engaged in the heavy industries. The members of the deputation complained that because urgent defence works received priority, ordinary works were being held up. As the Minister responsible for the administration of the Works Branch,I was urged to speed up as far as possible the various works which the Government has in hand or in prospect. I conferred with the Director-General of Works immediately after my return to Canberra, and urged a general speeding up of the letting of contracts and the calling of tenders, not only in relation to defence, but also in respect of other works for which money had been voted, in order that the unemployment situation might be relieved. The letting of a big contract in Sydney was hurried along, because I recognized that thatjob and others would provide a large amount of work for unemployed men. I also discussed the matter with the Acting Director of Works in Melbourne two or three days ago, and I was informed that all works in Victoria are being hurried along, including the new building for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the aeronautical laboratory. The department is engaging the services of additional draftsmen so that all approved works may be speeded up as much as possible in order to provide work for the unemployed. I have concentrated my efforts very largely on the works section of my department, because I realize the degree to which public works assist in the solution of the unemployment problem. We know that, unfortunately, owing to slackness in certain trades, unemployment has been growing in some industries. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Keane</inline> has complained of the lack of work for the Senate to perform. I expected that important bills would have been passed by the House of Representatives in time to enable the Senate to discuss them to-day. Circumstances over which I have no control have prevented that. The honorable senator also said that several bills with which the Senate has not yet dealt could have been originated in this chamber. I remind the honorable senator that of the bills which appear on the notice-paper of the House of Representatives, six have already been passed by the Senate, and that several ministerial statements appearing on the notice-paper of the House of Representatives have already been disposed of by this chamber. It is customary for the Minister in charge of important bills to introduce them in the chamber of which be is a member. I assure honorable senators that I will do everything I oan to meet their convenience in this regard. </para>

        <para>The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will be brought before the Cabinet. An effort will lbc made to ensure that- there shall be no unnecessary speeding up at the close of this period of the session. </para>
        <para>T propose to add very little to what has been said regarding unemployment. </para>
        <para class="block">I remind honorable senators that the Government has made substantial contributions to tbe States in order to assist them in the training of youths who, during the depression, were unable to secure the training necessary for them to become skilled tradesmen. Unfortunately, circumstances over which we have no control, such as have been brought about by drought conditions, have increased unemployment, and the position has been made more acute, particularly in rural industries, by the low prices which we have received for our export commodities. I assure honorable senators that the Government is pushing on with development and defence as quickly as possible. When the Statistician&#39;s figures are made available at the end of June it will bc seen that the new industries established, and the number of persons employed in factories, will constitute a record for Australia. Nevertheless, the unemployment problem is still a serious one, and I assure honorable senators&#39; opposite that tbe Government is just as anxious as they are to overcome it. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline>has expressed dissatisfaction with the replies made to certain questions which he has asked. All I can say is that the Treasury officers have done their very best to supply him with adequate answers. I am afraid, however, that the financial theories of the honorable senator are such that he will never be satisfied. </para>
